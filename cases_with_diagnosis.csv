PMC8184239_01,PMC8184239,Male,41.0,"A 41-year-old Indonesian male came to our outpatient clinic due to swelling in fingers and toes for the last nine months. He had limitations in activities of daily living. There was no history of shortening of the digits and joint stiffness in the mornings. Upon physical examination, the patient had leonine facies and madarosis. Hypesthetic hypopigmented macules were found on the right side of the back. (Figure 1) Sensory nerves examination revealed glove and stocking hypesthesia. Fingers and toes were swollen, without redness, warmth, and tenderness on the overlying skin. (Figure 2A) The range of motion was limited in the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers. Claw fingers, drop wrist, muscle atrophy, or contracture of the hands was not detected. Claw toes, drop foot, muscle atrophy, or contracture of the feet was not found. A slit-skin smear showed a bacterial index of 4.38+ (Figure 3) and a morphological index of 79%. We referred the patient to the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatology to perform synovial fluid aspiration from the interphalangeal joint of the hand (Figure 4A). Acid-fast staining of synovial fluid from the interphalangeal joint of the hand revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli (Figure 4B). Histopathological examination on a hypesthetic macule from the back showed epidermal atrophy with Grenz zone. The dermis was minimally infiltrated with lymphocytes and foamy histiocytes, which confirmed the diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy. Radiographic features showed osteolysis and destruction of some phalanges of the hands, bone erosion and destruction of some phalanges of the feet, as well as destruction and subluxation of some hand joints (Figure 2B). These bone changes were concluded as osteomyelitis. The final diagnosis was lepromatous leprosy, osteomyelitis and chronic arthritis due to leprosy, with hand and foot deformities. The patient received multidrug therapy (MDT) for multibacillary (MB) leprosy. Improvements in swollen fingers and toes were observed within two months after the start of treatment. The patient could move hands more freely to do daily activities. There were no changes on skin lesions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8184239/,3,images/PMC8/PMC818/PMC8184239_01
PMC5228701_01,PMC5228701,Female,5.0,"We present the case of a 5 years and 9-month-old female patient, who was admitted in our clinic for inferior limb pain and painful edema of the right index finger. The anamnesis revealed that the patient's mother had complained of joint pain during childhood, and she was diagnosed with acute articular rheumatism. The patient's personal history underlined that she had complained of inferior limb pain for approximately 1 year, but in the last month she associated painful edema of the right index finger, therefore she was referred to a pediatric surgeon, who suspected a proximal interphalangeal subjoint dislocation and requested a hand X-ray. The X-ray showed 2 opaque lesions in the right radial metaphysis, therefore she was admitted in our clinic for further investigations.
The clinical exam performed at the moment of admission revealed the following pathological elements: weight and height deficit, W: 17.6 kg (-0.88 SD), H: 109.5 cm (-1.02 SD), BMI: 14.7 (-0.78 SD), deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the right index finger (Fig. 1), abnormal position of the inferior limbs (genu valgum), and bilateral flat feet.
The laboratory test performed during admission, namely CBC count, transaminases, immunity status (IgA, IgM, and IgG) tests, peripheral smear, but also thyroid hormones, rheumatoid factor, antistreptolysin O titer, anticitrulinated protein antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, circulating immune complexes, parathormone, and serum phosphorus, were all within normal limits. The X-ray of inferior limbs revealed multiple metaphyseal osteochondromas of the distal femur, proximal tibia, and fibula of the 3rd right metatarsal bone, and proximal and medial phalanges of the 2nd, 3rd. and 4th right toes (Fig. 2, 3 and 4).
We also performed a thorax and a spinal column X-ray, but no pathological aspects were identified. We referred the patient to an endocrinologist, but both clinical and ultrasound exams of the thyroid gland were normal. We also requested a genetic consultation, and the genetics specialist suggested a radiological investigation of parents and also periodic radiological assessment of bone lesions with pediatric monitoring.
Based on all these clinical and radiologic findings, we established the diagnosis of multiple osteochondromas.
We assessed both parents radiologically in order to identify a possible hereditary transmission of these bone tumors. The mother X-rays revealed multiple osteochondromas of the left radius, bilateral femur, tibia, and peroneus, and also bilateral metatarsals.
Therefore, the final diagnosis was of HME.
We discharged the patient with the recommendation of radiological monitoring at least once a year or if any clinical sign of complications appears, taking under consideration the risk of malignant transformation. The radiological aspect at 6 month follow-up did not reveal any additional modifications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5228701/,2,images/PMC5/PMC522/PMC5228701_01
PMC5457932_01,PMC5457932,Male,73.0,"A 73-year-old man with disturbance of consciousness, headache and high fever was admitted to the cardiology department of our hospital, and was transferred to the neurological department on day 4. Significant past medical history included an episode of pneumonia 4 months prior and meningitis 2 months prior to this admission. Pneumonia resolved with 7 days of levofloxacin (LVFX), and meropenem (MPEM) was administered for meningitis for 14 days. In both instances, no etiology was detected. The patient was addicted to alcohol, consuming approximately 150 mL of ethanol each day. Physical examination on admission revealed high fever of 38.5C and arrhythmia. Neurological examination identified nuchal rigidity and mild disorientation, but no paresis or numbness. The patient was severely emaciated (height, 163 cm; weight, 43 kg). Although activities of daily life had been sufficient for independence before admission, he was unable to walk without assistance due to severe emaciation; a wheelchair was required for mobility.
Peripheral blood analysis on day 4 revealed mild pancytopenia (white blood cell count, 6,200 /muL; neutrophil count, 5,208 /muL; lymphocyte count, 682 /muL; hemoglobin, 10.2 g/dL; platelets, 88,000 /muL); and CRP, 1.44 mg/dL, representing a mild increase. The CD4 T-cell count was 23 /muL, but negative results were obtained for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody and polymerase chain reaction for HIV. Serum testing for beta-D-glucan, Aspergillus antigen and cryptococcal antigen were all negative. Tests to detect soluble interleukin 2 receptor, myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, proteinase 3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and antinuclear antibody markers for collagen disease were also all negative. The first cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, on day 4, revealed: cell count, 1,244 /muL (polymorphonuclear cells, 90%; monomorphonuclear cells, 10%); protein, 273 mg/dL; and glucose, 47 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose, 135 mg/dL) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Gram staining and smear for acid-fast bacilli yielded negative results. Adenosine deaminase and cryptoccocal antigen were likewise negative. Although CSF cultures were incubated for 2 weeks for bacteria and 8 weeks for mycobacteria, both appeared to yield negative results. At the same time, two sets of blood cultures were ordered and incubated for 4 weeks, and were still negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the head on admission showed a low-density area in the left uncal region and parietal cortex (figure not shown).
On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on day 14, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) revealed a high-intensity spot in the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle of the brain (Fig. 2A), implying ventriculitis. However, this region appeared iso-intense on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping (Fig. 2B). DWI also showed a high-intensity lesion with ADC iso-intensity in the left parietal cortex, judged as representing some kind of inactive lesion (figure not shown). On fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, a high-intensity lesion was detected in the white matter adjacent to the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle (Fig. 2C). The parietal cortex lesion was also signal hyperintense on FLAIR (figure not shown). Pneumonia was not detected on chest roentgenography or CT (figure not shown).
On day 4, bacterial meningitis was suspected and treatment with vancomycin (VCM), ceftriaxone (CTRX) and piperacillin (PIPC) was initiated (Fig. 1). Rifampicin (RFP), isoniazid (INH) and ethambutol (EB) were concomitantly administered for possible tuberculous meningitis. On day 10, a second analysis of CSF revealed non-significant changes compared with the first analysis: cell count, 802 /muL (polymorphonuclear cells, 90%; monomorphonuclear cells, 10%); protein, 196 mg/dL; and glucose, 34 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose, not determined) (Table 1). High fever had not resolved (Fig. 1). Because fungal meningitis was not able to be ruled out, liposomal amphotericin-B (L-AMB) was started. The regimen of VCM, CTRX, and PIPC regimen was switched to panipenem/betamipron (PAMP/BP) and minocycline (MINO). RFP, INH and EB were terminated due to low adenosine deaminase levels in the first CSF analysis. Although negative results were obtained for the CSF culture for fungi, fever resolved several days after beginning L-AMB (Fig. 1) and findings from the third CSF analysis on day 18 had improved: cell count, 128 /muL (polymorphonuclear cells, 83%; monomorphonuclear cells, 17%); protein, 117 mg/dL; and glucose, 38 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose, not determined) (Table 1, Fig. 1). Due to bone marrow suppression, L-AMB (100 mg once a day) was terminated on day 21.
Findings from the fourth CSF analysis, on day 29, showed further improvement: cell count, 40 /muL (polymorphonuclear cells, 65%; monomorphonuclear cells, 17%); protein, 152 mg/dL; and glucose, 41 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose, 101 mg/dL) (Table 1 and Fig. 1).
These improvements in CSF findings suggested that an undetected fungi was the causative microorganism and that L-AMB had been effective. Fever of 37-38C reappeared around day 35 (Fig. 1), and oral fluconazole (FCZ) was started on day 36. MINO and PAPM were continued until days 28 and 35, respectively. Fever did not resolve and loxoprofen was started on day 46. Fever reduced initially, but relapsed at 37-38C around day 60. A fifth CSF analysis on day 50 revealed worsened findings: cell count, 1,311 /muL (polymorphonuclear cells, 85%; monomorphonuclear cells, 15%); protein, 732 mg/dL; and glucose, 44 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose, not determined) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). DWI on days 50 and 71 revealed exacerbation of the ventriculitis (Fig. 2D and G) and partial ADC hypointensity (Fig. 2E and H). Spread of a hyperintense region was evident in the white matter adjacent to both lateral ventricles on FLAIR imaging (Fig. 2F and I). The area of high intensity may have represented brain edema due to ventriculitis. Direct paracentesis of the ventricle was considered, but the family of the patient declined to consent. Although CSF and MRI findings worsened, we persisted in suspecting fungal infection and continued with FCZ.
Disturbance of consciousness slowly worsened (Fig. 1), and aphasia and left hemispatial neglect gradually appeared around day 60. MRI on day 71 showed the ventriculitis and hyperintense lesion in the white matter adjacent to both lateral ventricles on FLAIR imaging had become more severe (Fig. 2D-F). Neither swelling of the brain nor encephalocele was seen. On days 71 and 84, pneumonia complicated the hospital course, resulting in administration of CTM for 9 days and MEPM for 11 days, respectively (Fig. 1). In both episodes of pneumonia, no causative bacteria were detected. Although the sixth CSF analysis on day 80 revealed improvements in cell count (268 /muL; polymorphonuclear cells, 86%; monomorphonuclear cells, 14%), no improvements were seen in protein (753 mg/dL) or glucose (34 mg/dL; simultaneous blood glucose, 104 mg/dL) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). FCZ was continued because of improvements in cell counts. The general condition of the patient did not improve and he died on day 99 due to transtentorial hernia, as confirmed on head CT (figures not shown). The transtentorial hernia was attributed to brain edema ventriculitis and meningitis. Repeated cultures of CSF and blood until death had consistently yielded negative results for bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria.
Autopsy was performed 2 hours after death. On opening the cranium, yellowish pus flowed from the left ventricle (Fig. 3A). This pus was not malodorous, and Gram staining revealed a delicate, branching, filamentous organism (Fig. 3B). Although acid-fast staining was not performed, the organism was determined to be a Nocardia species from the colony appearance, and was identified as N. araoensis by 16s rRNA gene sequencing. Pus was observed throughout the basal cistern and pontomedullary cistern (Fig. 3C). In formalin-fixed sections of brain, both lateral ventricles were filled with pus (Fig. 3D) and some small abscesses that had remained undetectable on MRI were seen in the cerebral white matter (Fig. 3E). No infectious lesions were identified in other organs, including the lungs and skin. No evidence of pancytopenia, such as hematological disease or liver cirrhosis, was found. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing showed that only doxycycline (DOXY), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and MINO seemed ineffective (Table 2). The final diagnosis was meningitis, ventriculitis and brain abscess due to N. araoensis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5457932/,14,images/PMC5/PMC545/PMC5457932_01
PMC4247007_01,PMC4247007,Male,65.0,"In January 2013, a 65-year-old male presented to Korea University Anam Hospital (Seoul, Republic of Korea), with an intra-abdominal mass that was localized to the right side. The mass had presented one month previously. In addition, the patient had experienced weight loss (5 kg) during the previous four months. The medical history was unremarkable, with the exception of pulmonary tuberculosis 30 years previously, from which the patient had recovered. On physical examination, a round mass was palpated and there was tenderness of the right upper quadrant area. Hematological examination revealed a marginal decrease of hematocrit (35.8%; normal range, 37-51%) and hemoglobin (11.8 g/dl; normal range, 12.6-17.4 g/dl). Liver function tests revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase (423 IU/l; normal range, 30-120 IU/l) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (587 IU/l; normal range, 9-64 IU/l) levels. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin levels were within the normal ranges of 3-45 IU/l, 3-45 IU/l and 0.0-0.4 mg/dl, respectively. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a subepithelial mass with a fistulous hole on the second portion of the duodenum (Fig. 1). A total colonoscopy revealed no abnormalities. A computed tomography (CT) scan, which was acquired from the referring local clinic (Choi Kang Sik Internal Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea), demonstrated a large, heterogeneously enhanced lobulated mass (11.5x9.3 cm; longest diameter x greatest perpendicular diameter) with internal necrosis at the pancreaticoduodenal groove (Fig. 2A). The internal cavity of the mass was connected to the second portion of the duodenum, which was consistent with the endoscopic findings. Furthermore, an ill-defined low-attenuation lesion was identified at segment eight of the liver, abutting the bile duct and hepatic artery (Fig. 2B). Significantly enlarged lymph nodes were not observed in the abdominal cavity. In addition, a fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan also revealed hypermetabolic masses in the duodenal groove and in segment eight of the liver, which was consistent with the CT scan. Abdominal MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) was also conducted for further characterization of the duodenal and hepatic masses observed on the CT scan, which confirmed the same findings. An ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the duodenal mass was performed and pathological examination identified whirling sheets of spindle-shaped cells (Fig. 3A). Immunohistochemical staining was positive for c-Kit, but negative for cluster of differentiation 34, S-100 and desmin (Fig. 3B). Mitotic features could not be evaluated, as a surgically excised sample was not obtained. The diagnosis of high-risk GIST with hepatic metastasis was determined and the patient was treated with 400 mg imatinib, daily. The treatment was tolerated well, and the abdominal mass and distension improved significantly. After seven weeks of treatment, the follow-up abdominal CT scan revealed that the duodenal mass had significantly reduced in size (7.9x6.5 cm; longest diameter x greatest perpendicular diameter) and exhibited an increased area of internal necrosis. However, the hepatic mass had increased from 1.7x1.5 cm to 3.9x3.2 cm in diameter (longest diameter x greatest perpendicular diameter) and the right hepatic duct was markedly dilated by the mass (Fig. 4). Various enlarged lymph nodes were observed in the left gastric area, including the porta hepatis and portocaval space. The ultrasound-guided needle biopsy was repeated for the hepatic mass and histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen showed malignant cells with a glandular structure, which was consistent with adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis exhibited c-Kit-negative and cytokeratin 19-positive staining (Fig. 5). The final diagnosis was synchronous ICC and GIST. Two weeks after the ultrasound-guided liver biopsy, the patient developed jaundice and a fever, and the total level of bilirubin increased rapidly to 9.4 mg/dl (normal range, 0.0-0.4 mg/dl). Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was conducted along with antibiotic treatment and administration of imatinib was withheld to allow the patient to recover from the condition. An abdominal CT scan following three weeks of conservative treatment revealed an increase in size of the liver mass (5.3x3.9 cm; longest diameter x greatest perpendicular diameter) with portal vein thrombosis, and the size of the duodenal mass had also increased to 9.5x8.7 cm (longest diameter x greatest perpendicular diameter). The treatment regimen became focused towards the ICC, which was associated with a poorer prognosis. Due to the well-known toxicity of combined chemotherapy, administration of imatinib was terminated and the patient was treated with intravenous gemcitabine (100 mg/m2 for 30 min, days 1 and 8) and cisplatin (25 mg/m2 for 1 h, days 1 and 8) every three weeks for four cycles. During chemotherapy, the abdominal mass reappeared, as a follow-up CT scan, performed six weeks following treatment, revealed a prominent increase in the size of the duodenal mass (10.7x10 cm; longest diameter x greatest perpendicular diameter). However, the hepatic mass did not demonstrate a significant change in size during that interval. As the patient had tolerated the initial chemotherapy well, combined chemotherapy (consisting of imatinib, gemcitabine and cisplatin) was initiated for symptom control and treatment of the GIST. The addition of imatinib resulted in the duodenal mass decreasing significantly and the patient exhibited a good response to the treatment. However, certain toxicities are associated with combined chemotherapy, such as grade 1 bone marrow suppression, as observed in the present case. The follow-up CT scan revealed disease progression of the ICC, whereas the size of the GIST mass had decreased. The treatment modality was altered, due to refractory cholangiocarcinoma, from chemotherapy to radiation therapy (daily dose of 180 Gy), whilst maintaining the imatinib treatment. To date, the patient has been undergoing treatment for one year and is tolerating the treatment well.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247007/,9,images/PMC4/PMC424/PMC4247007_01
PMC3364100_01,PMC3364100,Male,36.0,"A 36-year-old HIV-positive male was admitted to our institution due to a 2-week history of worsening headache and ataxia. He was originally diagnosed with HIV 8 months prior and had begun antiretroviral therapy at that time, including a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, efavirenz. Then, 4 months prior to this admission, the patient had experienced progressive ataxia and lower extremity paresthesias eventually leading to a brain MRI which showed an avidly enhancing extra-axial left cerebellar mass (fig. 1a) most consistent with benign meningioma. CD4+ count at that time was 44. No mass effect was noted and watchful waiting was elected at that time. The patient's symptoms were stable until the clinical decline preceding this most recent admission. Repeat MRI at this time showed that the cerebellar mass had expanded over a period of 4 months from 1.6 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm to 4.8 x 4.4 x 4.0 cm with effacement of the 4th ventricle, obstructive hydrocephalus, and additional small foci of similar enhancement located extra-axially at distant but still intracranial sites (fig. 1b, c). It was presumed that these additional foci represented spread of the primary process. At this point, the lesions were suspicious for atypical meningioma or hemangiopericytoma, primary CNS lymphoma, or infectious etiologies. Serum was negative for toxoplasma IgG. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus by polymerase chain reaction. Aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, viral, and acid-fast bacilli cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid were all negative.
The patient was brought to surgery to excise the tumor due to rapid enlargement and mass effect. Following posterior fossa craniotomy and microscope-aided cerebellar dissection, the tumor was identified as a rubbery yellow mass. Intra-operative frozen section specimens were labelled meningioma or hemangiopericytoma. Subtotal resection was then performed as the tumor was found to be extending through the tentorium. It was felt that adequate debulking had been performed despite leaving a small amount of residual tumor above the tentorium.
Examination of the permanent sections showed a densely cellular neoplasm comprised of spindle cells arranged in a solid and storiform pattern. The background blood vessels had a distinct staghorn-like pattern. Based on these features, the final diagnosis was hemangiopericytoma. The additional foci observed radiographically were not biopsied but were presumed to be metastases from the primary lesion. Following the surgery, the patient's neurologic symptoms were stable and the extra-ventricular drain was able to be removed on postoperative day 6. On postoperative day 10, the patient was discharged to a neurologic rehabilitation facility and after a short stay was discharged home. The patient underwent postoperative radiation therapy but, unfortunately, experienced a large recurrence of the cerebellar mass that required further surgery as well as interval increase in size in the accessory foci. The patient was undergoing additional rehabilitation at the time of submission of this work.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3364100/,3,images/PMC3/PMC336/PMC3364100_01
PMC3083533_01,PMC3083533,Male,60.0,"A 60-year-old male smoker presented with cough, expectoration, and left-sided chest pain for the past one month. Chest radiograph revealed a mass lesion in the left upper lung [Figure 1]. Computed tomography (CT) of thorax revealed a heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the left hemithorax with the involvement of lung and a major portion of posterior mediastinum. Ultrasound-guided FNAC was performed and smears were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E).
Smears were highly cellular with a myxoid background. Cells were ovoid to spindle shaped with relatively uniform nuclei and thin cytoplasm. Focal areas showed a rich capillary network within the myxoid matrix and occasional large atypical cells, both univacuolated and multivacuolated having scalloped nuclei [Figures 2 and 3]. A differential diagnosis of fibrosarcoma was considered initially but ruled out on recognizing lipoblasts and the rich capillary network. The final diagnosis was given as a myxoid liposarcoma metastatic to lung and posterior mediastinum. Subsequently, the patient underwent a CT-guided biopsy. Histopathological examination showed a multinodular tumor of moderate cellularity with enhanced cellularity at the periphery. The individual tumor cells were seen in a myxoid matrix with a delicate plexiform capillary vascular network and many cells resembled mature adipocytes [Figure 4]. Univacuolar and multivacuolar lipoblasts were seen; some having large atypical nuclei with scalloped margins. The tumor showed immunoreactivity for S100 protein. The previous tumor in the thigh was reviewed and confirmed with immunohistochemical marker S100 as a myxoid liposarcoma. A diagnosis of classic myxoid liposarcoma in lung was given and in view of a previous history of excision of myxoid liposarcoma in the thigh the final diagnosis was signed out as a metastatic myxoid liposarcoma to lung and posterior mediastinum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed secondary deposits in liver also.
The patient was advised chemotherapy after surgery in the thigh but was lost to follow-up and came with the mediastinal mass. Chemotherapy was offered after the current resection. Six cycles of chemotherapy were advised and the patient is responding well.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3083533/,1,images/PMC3/PMC308/PMC3083533_01
PMC10416791_01,PMC10416791,Male,23.0,"A 23-year-old man presented with asymptomatic papules on the glans was first noted at the age of 15 that were previously diagnosed as condylomata acuminata (CA) and subsequently treated with topical imiquimod cream for several months but without improvement. He was especially concerned about transmitting the lesions to his sexual partner. Physical examination revealed rows of monomorphic, soft flesh-colored filiform papules confluent over the entire glans with a ""cobblestone"" appearance accompanied by smaller papules in a linear arrangement on the corona (Figure 1). There was no enhancement of the papules with 5% acetic acid. Testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was negative.
Histopathologic examinations of shave biopsy specimens of the papules on the ventral glans demonstrated a polypoidal architecture with hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and focally elongated rete ridges (Figure 2a). The upper dermis featured abundant small vessels with perivascular fibroplasia (Figure 2b). Histologically, the lesions resembled acral angiofibroma. The final diagnosis was profound pearly penile papules (PPP), and the patient was assured of the non-contagious nature of the condition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10416791/,3,images/PMC1/PMC104/PMC10416791_01
PMC8602088_01,PMC8602088,Male,41.0,"A 41-year- old man with a history of atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis visited our hospital with a complaint of severe nasal obstruction that had gradually worsened since childhood. He also suffered from hyposmia and watery nasal discharge. On nasal endoscopy, the nasal septum was deviated to the right, the nasal mucosa was smooth and pink with nodular thickening, and the common nasal meatus was so narrow that the bilateral middle turbinates or posterior part of the nasal cavity were not visible (Figures 1A,B). Plain computed tomography (CT) revealed the deviation of the nasal septum to the right, thickening of the bilateral nasal mucosa, and deposition of microcalcified material in the submucosa of the nasal cavity, including the bilateral nasal septum, middle, and inferior turbinates (Figures 1C,D). Non-enhanced MRI showed bilateral thickening of the nasal mucosa and numerous hypointense punctate signal areas in the submucosa of the entire nasal cavity on both T1- and T2-weighted images (Figures 1E,F). An excision biopsy of the left inferior turbinate was undertaken on the day of the first visit to our hospital. A histological examination revealed large deposits of amorphous eosinophilic substance with calcification (Figure 2A), which was stained black by von Kossa staining (Figure 2B), and the presence of amyloid on Congo-red staining with apple-green birefringence when viewed with polarized light (Figure 2C). Immunohistochemistry was positive for serum amyloid L protein and kappa immunoglobin light chain. The patient was referred to the department of internal medicine in our hospital, where he was assessed for systemic disease. A complete blood count (CBC), and liver and renal function tests revealed normal results, and serum and urine electrophoresis was negative for Bence Jones protein and M protein. Duodenal and rectal biopsy using digestive tract fiberscopes did not show the deposition of amyloid in the tissue, and a bone marrow biopsy from the pelvis was negative for multiple myeloma. Echocardiography and electrocardiography revealed a normal heart function. Based on these findings, the final diagnosis was localized amyloidosis (AL kappa type) of the nasal mucosa.
In order to improve his main symptom of nasal obstruction, septoplasty and bilateral inferior turbinectomy were performed at 4 months after the patient's first visit to our department. In the inferior turbinectomy, we applied the submucosal resection with powered instrumentation to preserve the ciliary function of the mucosa and to prevent postoperative crusting and bleeding. A mucosal incision was made in the anterior head of the inferior turbinate, the mucosa on the sides of the common and middle nasal meatus was detached from the bone, and submucosal resection was performed to remove as much thickened submucosal tissue as possible using a microdebrider. The bone of the inferior turbinate was not removed in consideration of the possibility of reoperation for recurrence of the lesion in the future. In septoplasty, the Killian approach with cartilage preservation was used and the deviated perpendicular plate of ethmoid bone and vomer were resected. The thickened submucosal tissues of the bilateral septal mucosa were reduced in the same manner as in the inferior turbinectomy. Since the submucosal tissue with severe calcification was very hard and difficult to resect with the turbinate blade of a microdebrider (Figure 3A), an ultrasonic bone curette (UBC) (Sonopet ) was also used to partially resect the submucosal tissue by shaving it off (Figure 3B). The use of these two devices allowed us to enlarge the bilateral nasal meatus, albeit partially, while preserving some of the mucosal surface. No surgical manipulation of the external nose or nasal septum cartilage was performed based on the patient's wishes. There were no complications during surgery. To prevent postoperative mucosal adhesion and dryness, one 0.5-mm thick silicone plate was inserted into each nasal cavity, sutured to the mucosa of the nasal septum, and removed after 1 month. Subjective nasal obstruction was assessed using the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale and a visual analog scale (VAS) pre and postoperatively. A VAS was a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by the word ""No nasal obstruction at all"" at the left end and by the word ""Complete nasal obstruction"" at the right end, and we asked the patient to mark the point that represented his perception of his current state on the line. The VAS score was determined by measuring in millimeters (mm) from the left end of the line to the point that the patient marks. At 6 months postoperatively, the symptoms of nasal obstruction had markedly improved and there were no significant post-operative symptoms. The NOSE scale improved from 8 points preoperatively to 3 points postoperatively on a 20-point scale and the VAS score improved from 72 mm preoperatively to 25 mm after surgery. The objective evaluation of nasal obstruction using rhinomanometry also revealed the improvement of nasal resistance in both nostrils (Figures 3C,D). CT revealed the enlargement of the bilateral common nasal meatus (Figure 3E). At 8 months after surgery, there was no recurrence or progression of symptoms. The patient is currently being followed up and is satisfied with the improvement of nasal obstruction and the absence of symptoms after surgery.
We only identified 21 case reports of localized amyloidosis originating from the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses that included detailed patient information in 20 English-language articles published from 1990 to date. The clinical characteristics of the reported cases localized sinonasal amyloidosis, including our own, are shown in Table 1. Cases of localized amyloidosis originating from the nasopharynx were excluded from this review.
In the 22 case reports included in our literature review (Table 1), the mean age of patients with localized sinonasal amyloidosis was 42.4 years (range: 8-81 years). Eight of the patients were men and 14 were women; thus, there is a female predominance in the incidence of localized sinonasal amyloidosis.
Regarding the past medical history of the patients, 4 cases (18.2%) had no history and 3 cases (13.6%) had a history of nasal surgery. In addition, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, radiotherapy for a nasal cavity lymphoma, nasal trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, monoclonal gammopathy, and ear discharge were reported in one case each (4.5%). The past medical history was not described in 9 cases (40.9%) reported in 8 studies. Three cases (13.6%), including our case, had no relevant family history, and the remaining case reports did not describe the family history.
The clinical symptoms of the patients included nasal obstruction (including nasal difficulty, nasal blockage, nasal congestion or stuffiness) (n = 18; 81.8%), bleeding (including recurrent epistaxis, n = 9; 40.9%), rhinorrhea or nasal discharge (n = 7; 31.8%). Facial swelling and olfactory impairment (including anosmia or hyposmia) were found in 4 cases each (18.2%). Mouth breathing, epiphora and hearing impairment [including aural fullness, described as ""auricular plenitude"" in the case report by Saas et al. ], were found in 3 cases each (13.6%). Headache, facial pain, facial discomfort, or recurrent sinusitis (including maxillary and frontal sinusopathy) were found in 2 cases each (9.1%). Snoring, eye pain, proptosis with visual impairment, cerebral fluid leak from the nostril, severe malaise and diffuse arthralgia were found in one case each (4.5%).
The duration of symptoms was 1 year in 6 cases (27.2%), 2 years in 4 cases (18.2%), and since early childhood in 2 cases (9.1%). One patient each (4.5%) reported that the duration of symptoms was several months, 3 years, 4 years, 7 years, 8 years, and several years. The duration of symptoms was not described in 4 reports.
The locations of lesions included nasal mucosa (including septum, floor, middle or inferior turbinate) (n = 20; 90.9%), maxillary sinus or antrum (n = 8; 36.4%), ethmoid sinus (n = 6; 27.3%), frontal sinus (n = 3; 13.6%) and sphenoid sinus (n = 2; 9.1%). Extra-nasal or extra-sinus extension to the sella, parasellar region, clivus, hard palate, pterygoid process and nasal bone were found in one case each (4.5%) in 4 case reports.
The laterality of regions included bilateral lesions in 12 cases (54.5%), and right- and left-side regions in 5 cases each (22.7%).
Regarding the findings of local examinations, a mass in the nose was found in 14 cases (63.6%). The mass was characterized as erythematous (n = 4), pale pink or pale (n = 3), friable (n = 2), smooth (n = 2), soft to firm (n = 2), and non-tender (n = 2). Local examinations revealed adhesion (or synaechie) and nasal polyp in 3 cases each. Thickening of the mucosa of the nasal cavity, especially affecting the nasal septum and nasal conchae was reported in 5 cases (22.7%) and localized lesions in the nasal mucosa were reported in 2 cases, which were described as a partially yellow granular nodule (n = 1) and an erythematous irregular area (n = 1).
Regarding the diagnostic imaging studies, X-ray, CT, and MRI were used in 2 (9.1%), 21 (95.5%), and 10 (45.5%) cases, respectively. Of the 21 patients who underwent CT, all showed increased lesions of soft tissue density located in the nose or sinuses; findings included opacification, mass or mucosal thickening of the nasal meatus or sinus, and masses. Among them, calcification in the lesion was observed in 5 cases (23.8%), osteitic, osteotic, or reactive bone change were observed in 3 cases (14.3%), and destructive changes of the bone or osteolysis were observed in 4 cases (19.0%). MRI signal intensity of the amyloid legion was documented on T1-weighted images in five cases and T2-weighted images in six cases. For T1-weighted images, three of the five cases (60.0%) were hypointense and two were hypointense to isointense (40.0%); for T2-weighted images, three of the six cases were hypointense (50.0%), one was hypointense to isointense (16.7%), one was dominantly hyperintense (16.7%), and one was hyperintense in the periphery and hypointense in the center (16.7%).
Regarding the type of amyloid protein, 11 cases in 10 studies were subjected to an immunohistochemical examination. Among them, serum amyloid light protein (AL) was positive in 8 cases, including kappa immunoglobin light chain in 2 cases, lambda immunoglobin light chain in one case and both kappa and lambda in one case. The remaining 3 case reports described negative studies for AL, serum amyloid A protein (AA) and both (n = 1 each).
Seventeen cases (81.8%) were treated with surgery. Among them, 4 cases (18.2%) were treated bv diagnostic surgery or excisional biopsy alone. The remaining 13 patients underwent resection or debulking of the lesion, with sinus surgery performed as needed. In one case, chemotherapy (four 28-day cycles of melphalan [8 mg] and dexamethasone [40 mg/day] on days 1-4) was administered prior to surgery, but no reduction was seen. External radiotherapy was selected for a large destructive amyloid lesion in one case and the progression of the amyloid lesion was halted. Observation was selected in one case and the details of treatment were not described in 2 cases. Recurrence or the progression of the disease was confirmed in 7 of the 15 cases in which it was described (46.7%).
The mean follow-up period was 20.4 months (range, 1.5 months [6 weeks] to 48 months [4 years]).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8602088/,14,images/PMC8/PMC860/PMC8602088_01
PMC4996609_01,PMC4996609,Male,72.0,"A 72-year-old white male with extensive smoking history presented to our clinic by referral from his general surgeon. We were requested to further evaluate an atrophic left kidney and infiltrating left renal mass. In 1962, he had a splenectomy secondary to trauma that required midline and left subcostal incisions. In the year before our consultation, he had undergone three separate abdominal surgeries: laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair, incisional hernia repair, and recurrent incisional hernia repair with mesh. He reported a persistent bulge in the upper aspect of his incisional hernia repair.
He underwent CT imaging as part of the work-up to evaluate for a recurrent incisional hernia, which showed marked left renal atrophy and a 5.5 cm infiltrative left lower pole mass causing hydronephrosis (Fig. 1). Management options were discussed with the patient, and he wished to forego a renal biopsy and proceed with surgical removal. We performed a robot-assisted laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy with excision of bladder cuff. All dissections were performed robotically, including the distal ureter and bladder cuff. General surgery performed a laparoscopic repair of his incisional hernia with mesh in conjunction with our surgery.
Gross analysis of the nephroureterectomy specimen showed an 8 x 4.5 x 4 cm kidney. Bisection of the kidney showed a dense infiltrative process involving the soft tissue of the hilum as well as the fat of the renal sinus (Fig. 2). The mass was noted to extensively involve the specimen and measured 9 x 5 x 3.5 cm. It extended close to the inked surface of the kidney and also traveled along vessels to the vascular margins.
Microscopic analysis of the 9 cm renal mass depicted a monomorphic lymphoid process (Figs. 3 and 4). Immunohistochemistry was performed at our local hospital that demonstrated the lymphoid cells were CD20 and CD79 positive, while lacking staining for CD3, CD5, CD10, and CD68. The specimen was sent to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, for further evaluation. Their pathologist noted a diffuse infiltrate of small lymphocytes in a sclerotic background. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of the specimen indicated that 100% of the cells had a BCL2 separation as well as a BCL6 separation. The diagnosis was follicular lymphoma, grade I (of III).
The patient recovered well postoperatively. His cystogram showed no extravasation and his foley catheter was removed. He was seen by oncology for further management of his lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated 5% involvement of the bone marrow by the follicular lymphoma. PET scan showed evidence of lymphadenopathy in the retrocrural region adjacent to his hiatal hernia and in the right lower pelvic lymph nodes. There were no signs of any visceral metastases. Given the bone marrow involvement, the final diagnosis was stage IVA, grade 1 follicular lymphoma. His beta-2 microglobulin level was elevated, which portends a poorer prognosis. He began chemotherapy with rituximab (monoclonal antibody that binds B-lymphocyte CD20) and bendamustine (alkylating agent). He has finished two cycles of treatment to date.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4996609/,7,images/PMC4/PMC499/PMC4996609_01
PMC7476697_01,PMC7476697,Male,61.0,"A 61-year-old unmarried male came with the complaints of right hip pain with the inability to bear weight on the right lower limb for 1 month. There was no history of trauma or other systemic symptoms. He had consulted the local practitioner, who advised an X-ray, which was reported as osteopoikilosis (spotted bone disease) by the radiologist. He was asked to take bed rest and analgesics but the pain persisted.
The patient then visited our tertiary center where the thorough skeletal survey was done, which showed involvement of pelvis (Fig. 1 and 2), spine (Fig. 3), and appendicular skeleton(Fig. 4 and 5) as well. The lesions were osteolytic, small, multiple, of varied sizes involving the whole of the involved bone, rather symmetrically (Fig. 6).
The X-ray with which the patient presented showed superior cortical breach in the femoral neck, but on traction X-ray, the pathological trans-cervical neck femur fracture was noted (Fig. 1). Differential diagnoses considered were metastasis, osteopoikilosis, and multiple myeloma.
Further laboratory investigations were suggestive of high alkaline phosphatase level (1933 U/L) while normal calcium, phosphorus, Vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone level. Further investigation prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was normal, 24h urinary Bence-Jones proteins negative, and bone biopsy shows immune-histochemistry positive for prostatic metastasis. A transurethral biopsy of the prostate came negative while a per-rectal biopsy of the prostate came positive for small cell carcinoma. The bone scan pattern was of super-scan while computed tomography scan showed carcinoma of the prostate with an invasion of the seminal vesicles and extension along the floor and left lateral wall of the urinary bladder leading to urethral obstruction and bilateral hydronephrosis.
The final diagnosis was extensive skeletal metastasis with primary from the prostate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7476697/,3,images/PMC7/PMC747/PMC7476697_01
PMC5841933_01,PMC5841933,Female,6.0,"A 6-year-old girl, of Turkish descent, presented with a 6-week history of right posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. She had no recent history of fever, night sweats or weight loss. Past medical history was significant for FMF with a known M694V mutation in the MEFV gene (and an r40w variant of unknown significance in the MVK gene), diagnosed at age one year and well managed with colchicine 0.3 mg orally twice/day. Complete blood count (CBC) showed white blood cell count 8.3 x 103/mul, hemoglobin 130 g/L, and platelet count 298,000/mul. Lactate dehydrogenase was 850 IU/L, uric acid 174 umol/L and ESR 2 mm/h. An excisional biopsy of a cervical lymph node showed effacement of the normal nodal architecture with a smaller population of large atypical cells with large prominent eosinophilic nucleoli and occasional classical diagnostic Reed-Sternberg cells. Immunohistochemical stains revealed positivity for CD30, CD15 and PAX5. The tumour cells were focally positive for CD3 and negative for ALK-1, CD45 and CD20. In situ hybridization for EBV-EBER (where EBER is Epstein-Barr encoding region) was positive in the majority of large atypical cells. Staging included PET computerized tomography which demonstrated localized hypermetabolic right cervical lymph nodes with the absence of bulk disease. Therefore, the final diagnosis was stage IIA classical Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis subtype. The patient (Figure 1) was treated according to the local standard of care for low risk HL using 2 cycles of OEPA (vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose IV days 1, 8 and 15, etoposide 125 mg/m2/dose IV days 1-5, prednisone 60 mg/m2/day PO days 1-15, and doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 15) chemotherapy only.
Her first treatment course was complicated by prolonged myelosuppression including CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia, fever and severe abdominal pain. She needed to be admitted on day 8 for clinical sepsis, requiring three intravenous fluid boluses and antibiotics. Furthermore the second infusion of Vincristine and Doxorubicin was postponed to Day 16. No other signs of colchicine toxicity, such as bloody stool, renal failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation were noted. Blood cultures remained negative. She was discharged home after twelve days but needed readmission on day 22 due to severe abdominal pain and loose stools, treated with intravenous hydration and morphine for nine days. After consultation with the Rheumatology service, colchicine was discontinued from day 27 of cycle 1 onwards, to prevent possible interactions with chemotherapy. Cycle 2 was started 36 days after start of cycle 1. She tolerated this much better, without any complications and count recovery within the expected timeframe. Clinical and radiographic evaluations showed no evidence of disease at the end of therapy. The patient currently remains in remission 17 months after completion of therapy. Subsequently, she developed similar fever attacks and colchicine was resumed at the same dose 3 months after completion of chemotherapy. Her FMF has been well controlled since, without any signs of colchicine toxicity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5841933/,1,images/PMC5/PMC584/PMC5841933_01
PMC8677941_01,PMC8677941,Male,63.0,"A 63-year-old male presented on November 16, 2018, with complaints of persistent left epistaxis and a history of swelling in the left orbit and maxillary sinus for 3 months. Examination revealed multiple enlarged, indurated, and painless lymph nodes in the cervical and left submandibular areas, the largest of which was 4 mm x 3 mm. Blood tests at diagnosis showed anemia (Hb 122 g/L) and thrombocytopenia (90 x 109/L). Syphilis and HIV screenings were negative. Initial enhancement MRI scanning on November 27, 2018, revealed heterogeneous enhancement shadow filling in the left maxillary sinus along with adjacent bone absorption (Figure 1A).
The patient underwent a subsequent biopsy by nasal endoscopy on November 29, 2018. Histology highlighted a diffuse infiltrate of large atypical cells with lymphocytic or plasmacytoid morphology (Figures 2A,B). Neoplastic cells expressed a high proliferative index (Ki-67, 95%) (Figure 2C). Immunohistochemical profiling showed positive results in neoplastic cells for MUM1, CD38, CD138, c-myc, and EBV-EBER, the ratio of kappa chain (+) neoplastic cells to lambda chain (+) neoplastic cells is greater than 64:1 (Figures 2D-F), and they were negative for CD30, CD19, CD79a, PAX-5, CD20, CD21, bcl-6, CD10, bcl-2, CD15, HMB45, S-100, MelanA, CK, and EMA (Figures 2G-I).18F-FDG PET/CT was performed for further assessment of the mass lesion metabolic activity and the general conditions at diagnosis on December 6, 2018. Transverse PET/CT scan revealed a 3.7 cm x 3.9 cm x 4.3 cm solid mass, partial bone destruction, and swelling of soft tissues. A markedly FDG-avid space-occupying lesion was observed at the left maxillary sinus, and it invaded the left nasal cavity, left orbital apex, and left alar mandibular space (SUVmax, 7.8; SUVmean, 6.3) (Figure 3A). Bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy were negative for lymphoma involvement. The screening investigations specific for multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma results showed that this patient was negative for serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, and free light chain assay. The final diagnosis was confirmed to be consistent with stage II PBL.
With curative intent, bortezomib was initiated (2.3 mg d1, 4, 8, 11) in combination with CDOP (cyclophosphamide 1.3 g d2, epirubicin 40 mg d2, vindesine 4 mg d21, prednisolone 65 mg d2-6) chemotherapy regimen on a 21-day cycle. After two cycles of V-CDOP, enhanced MRI scanning on February 11, 2019, revealed an excellent initial response, with a substantial decrease in the size and intensity of nasopharyngeal lesions (Figure 1B). After three cycles of the V-CDOP regimen, re-evaluation of the 18F-FDG PET/CT in the transverse dimension on May 21, 2019, showed a diminished range of lesions to 3.8 cm x 2.9 cm x 3.8 cm and reduced 18F-FDG uptake in the left maxillary sinus (SUVmax, 7.0; SUVmean, 4.5) and other regions (SUVmax, 4.0; SUVmean, 3.6) (Figure 3B). The patient achieved a partial response (PR) after five cycles of V-CDOP chemotherapy treatment.
This planned treatment was followed by mobilization and collection of autologous peripheral blood stem cells on May 24, 2019. After one cycle of V-CDOP, enhanced MRI scanning revealed no significant change on June 27, 2019 (Figure 1C). On regular follow-up, he received local radiotherapy (RT) to nasopharyngeal regions (30 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks). After RT, he was switched to two cycles of V-CDOP regimens supplemented with lenalidomide (25 mg d1-21) on August 9 and September 10, 2019. The main toxic side effect was grade 2 myelosuppression and improved after symptomatic treatment. Subsequent enhancement MRI scanning revealed a reduction in the size of nasopharyngeal lesions on September 14, 2019 (Figure 1D). The therapeutic assessment by FDG PET/CT on September 29, 2019, showed a complete metabolic response (cMR), a diminished range of lesions to 1.0 cm x 1.3 cm, significantly reduced 18F-FDG uptake in the left maxillary sinus (SUVmax, 3.5; SUVmean, 2.5), and a lack of metabolic activity in other regions (Figure 3C).
The patient received conditioning BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) high-dose chemotherapy with consolidative autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in October 25, 2019. A total of 8.6 x 108/kg mononuclear cells (MNCs) and 2.1 x 106/kg CD34+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBSCs) were reinfused, and complete engraftment was observed by day + 11. During autologous transplantation, he experienced grade 4 myelosuppression, requiring G-CSF. To consolidate the response, the patient received lenalidomide-based maintenance therapy after the transplant. A repeated enhancement MRI scanning showed increased abnormal signal shadows in the maxillary sinus, which was considered as an inflammatory reaction on May 6, 2020 (Figure 1E). He developed herpes zoster during maintenance treatment on October 2020. Follow-up PET-CT on March 10, 2021 showed continued cMR 16 months after ASCT (Figure 3D). Currently, the patient was monitored with serial MRI scanning and presented 32 months OS and 22 months PFS.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8677941/,14,images/PMC8/PMC867/PMC8677941_01
PMC8565704_01,PMC8565704,Female,72.0,"A 72-year-old female patient with multiple comorbidities: type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertensive and ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, stage 3b chronic kidney disease, recent SARS CoV2 infection presented at the emergency room with a 2-month history of obstructive respiratory symptoms, with progressive aggravation. Prior to that the patient was addressed to the surgery department by an endocrinologist, but due to the SARS CoV2 infection thyroidectomy was postponed. The patient was from a mildly iodine insufficient non-Alpine area, yet the iodine status of the patient was not available. Clinical examination of the anterior cervical region and paraclinical investigations (cervical computed tomography) identified a 93/90/76 mm large, inhomogeneous soft consistency mass on the topography of the left thyroid lobe that displaced to the right the trachea and cervical esophagus. Otorhinolaryngology examination identified left recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. There was no evidence of other primary malignancies or metastatic dissemination at the thoracic and cervical CT. Blood examination showed euthyroid status, normal calcitonin level, moderate normochromic and normocytic anemia, and a stage 3b chronic kidney disease. Mild hypocalcemia was also present. Despite age and significant comorbidities resulting in high anesthesia risk, intense obstructive respiratory symptoms established the indication for surgery. Intraoperative examination revealed a solid tumor mass on the topography of the left thyroid lobe with invasion of infrahyoidian muscles, trachea, left recurrent laryngeal nerve and cervical esophagus. Lymphadenopathy was not identified in the central and lateral compartments. A total thyroidectomy and excision of the invaded infrahyoid muscles was performed. Postoperatively, following a period of 48 hours when the patient was maintained intubated and ventilated, a major improvement of the respiratory status was noticed. The surgical specimen was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution. At gross examination, a tumor that measured 80/60/40mm, partially circumscribed by a pseudocapsule, was observed. The cut surface was variegated with solid and cystic areas. Necrosis was present in the solid areas and hemorrhage was extensive. Both lobes of the thyroid gland were involved by the tumor along with the isthmus and the infrahyoid muscles (Figure 1).
Microscopic examination identified a vasoformative high grade proliferation with large uni- or multinucleated epithelioid cells with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm lining abnormal vascular channels containing papillary fronds (Figure 2A) or growing in solid sheets (Figure 2B). Intracytoplasmic lumina with erythrocytes were present in some of the cells. Extensive areas of hemorrhage and tumor necrosis were also noted. The mitotic rate was high with frequent atypical mitotic figures. Perineural invasion and angioinvasion were present. Extra-thyroid soft tissues including the infrahyoid muscles were infiltrated by the tumor. The residual thyroid gland showed features of multinodular colloid goiter.
On immunohistochemistry, among endothelial cell markers, only CD31 showed intense diffuse membrane positivity (Figure 3A). Other two endothelial cell markers (CD34 and D2-40) were negative (Figures 3B and 3C). CK AE1/AE3, an epithelial differentiation marker, was focally positive (Figure 3D). TTF-1, thyroglobulin and calcitonin were diffusely negative in tumor cells. Based on the morphological aspects and immunohistochemical profile, the final diagnosis was primary angiosarcoma of thyroid with extra-thyroid extension to infrahyoid muscles. Postoperatively, the patient developed hypoparathyroidism with severe hypocalcemia that responded to intravenous calcium administration and oral alfacalcidolum (activated vitamin D3). The patient was discharged in good clinical condition with recommendation for clinical and paraclinical endocrinological evaluation and initiation of hormone replacement therapy. After discharge, the patient did not receive postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy due to chronic kidney disease and died one month later in the nephrology unit.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8565704/,8,images/PMC8/PMC856/PMC8565704_01
PMC3292829_01,PMC3292829,Female,54.0,"A 54-year-old, non-smoker woman presented to her primary care physician for chronic, non-productive cough and mild dyspnoea. Her past medical history included partial gastrectomy for gastric ulcer, colecystectomy, dyslipidemia and gastric reflux disease. She also reported a previous occupational exposure to benzene.
Clinical examination was unremarkable and pulmonary function was normal. The chest X-ray and the subsequent enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the presence of a well-circumscribed, ovular, smooth edged, dense pulmonary lesion in the left inferior hilum (Figure 1). The diameter of the nodule was approximately 18 mm, with no contrast enhancement. No other significant abnormalities were detected, in particular there was neither pleural effusion nor mediastinal adenopathy. The patient underwent a fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan, revealing minor uptake in the left lower lobe nodule with a Standardized Uptake Value of 1.06. The brain and the abdomen CT scans were negative for metastatic localizations.
In order to exclude a malignancy, a fibreoptic bronchoscopy with bronchial washing and a percutaneous CT-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy were performed. Both the examinations resulted negative for malignant disease.
Notwithstanding the negative results of the cytological investigations, the PET finding and the contiguity to the hilar structures convinced the authors to remove the pulmonary nodule. Therefore, a minimally invasive muscle-sparing lateral thoracotomy was performed in order to biopsy the pulmonary lesion. The intraoperative histological examination by frozen section suggested a cystic, well-delineated lesion without sign of malignant disease; however, the finding had to be confirmed by the definitive histology obtained by paraffin block.
Considering the nodule localization (inseparable from the inferior pulmonary vein) and the intraoperative histological finding, we decided for a left lower lobectomy. The surgical procedure and the postoperative course were uneventful. The patient has been discharged 5 days after the operation in good clinical condition; after one year, she is in good health and the chest CT scan doesn't reveal any sign of recurrence.
The resected lung segment contained a well-defined yellowish, round mass, with a diameter of approximately 2 cm, with a tight adhesion to the wall of the adjacent left inferior vein.
Histologically, the mass was well demarcated (Figure 2a) and composed of a network of cystic spaces lined with simple epithelial cuboidal type II pneumocytes cells without atypia that contain stroma ranging from thin inconspicuous strands of connective tissue to broad spectrum of spindle cells sometimes in a myxoid matrix (Figure 2b). Neither mitotic figures nor necrosis were detectable. The immunohistochemical profile in the epithelial component was positive for thyroid transcription factor (TTF-1) (Figure 2c) and negative for myogenin, surfactant and cytokeratins. The mesenchimal spindle cells components were unreactive for CD34, CD68 and desmin. The proliferative activity was assessed by Ki-67 and was unremarkable in both cell types.
Due to the morphological apparence and immunohistochemical findings of the lesion the final diagnosis was alveolar adenoma of the lung.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292829/,2,images/PMC3/PMC329/PMC3292829_01
PMC7265051_01,PMC7265051,Male,65.0,"A 65-year-old man had an abnormality (filling defect) of the upper gastrointestinal series in his first medical checkup five years prior. The patient had undergone distal gastrectomy for a gastric ulcer at age forty. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed a 10 mm submucosal tumor-like lesion in the greater curvature of the upper gastric remnant body. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a hypo-echoic tumor located in the third layer. Blood test findings revealed a carcinoembryonic antigen level of 3.8 ng/mL and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level of 6 U/mL, indicating the tumor markers were within the normal range. Because there was no sign of malignancy, the gastric lesion was followed up by annual EGD (Fig. 1). A delle was observed on the top of the tumor five year after the first visit and a biopsy specimen revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2). Contrast computed tomography (CT) showed no nodal or distant metastasis. Laparoscopic gastrectomy and lymph node dissection for remnant gastric cancer was performed. Histological assessment revealed a 28 x 22 mm elevated lesion with a slight depression. Microscopically, papillary adenocarcinoma was observed with a solitary heterotopic gastric gland (sHGG) surrounding by smooth muscle tissues (Fig. 3). Immunohistochemical staining of sHGG, MUC5AC and MUC6 were positive, and MUC1 and MUC2 were negative (Fig. 4). These results revealed the sHGG originated from the stomach. There was smooth muscle tissue around the adenocarcinoma and sHGG was found only in the submucosa. Immunohistochemical staining of the smooth muscle tissues revealed SMA and Vimentin/desmin were positive, S-100a was weak positive, and C-kit/CD34 was negative (data not shown). The final diagnosis was papillary adenocarcinoma arising from a solitary heterotopic gastric gland in the leiomyoma [pT2(MP)N0M0, ly0(D2-40), v0, pPM0, pDM0: according to the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma].

PMC8112237_01,PMC8112237,Female,54.0,"A 54-year-old female was admitted with right upper abdominal pain, and was diagnosed with right-sided colon cancer through electronic colonoscopy. The diagnosis was further confirmed by biopsy in February 2018. Physical examination was normal and computed tomography (CT) revealed a solid mass in the colonic hepatic flexure with extensive mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph node metastases. The patient had a history of severe hypertension and her family history showed that her father had bladder cancer and had died in 2019. In May 2018, surgical pathology revealed an invasive, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma where two out of thirteen mesenteric lymph nodes were positive. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed pMMR, BRAFV600E mutation and a Ki67 proliferative index of 80% while the overall pathology report indicated a T3 N2b M0 stage IIIC CRC ( Figure 1 ).
To seek potential therapeutic options, the patient's colorectal carcinoma was also subjected to IHC analysis of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). The tumor proportion score (TPS) reached 30%, whereas the combined positive score (CPS) reached 35 ( Figure 2 ). Additionally, upon next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), the patient was identified to MSS ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). The final diagnosis was with mCRC with MSS and BRAFV600E mutation.
The patient initially received four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6: oxaliplatin, 150 mg; d1 + 5-fluorouracil, 0.5 g; d1 + maintenance dose of 3.25 g for 46 h). Subsequently, she underwent a right hemicolectomy procedure on May 8, 2018. She received four cycles of mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy followed by her surgery. However, positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) showed the disease progression as developed retroperitoneal lymph node metastases (29 x 23 mm) ( Figure 3 ). According to the result of PET-CT, the patient was switched on to FOLFIRI chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab for four cycles. After two months, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed that the disease progressed due to the enlargement (24 x 17 mm) of the lymph node ( Figure 4 ). Due to the poor condition of the patient, she agreed to adopt the treatment option of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor combined with anti-angiogenic therapy. Consequently, the patient was then prescribed a dosage regimen of nivolumab (140 mg) in combination with bevacizumab (300 mg) every two weeks for 11 cycles (November 23, 2018 to May 5, 2019). Due to the partial response (PR) observed in the MRI scan, the tumor collection diameter (19x16 mm) was reduced by 30.1% ( Figure 4 ), subsequently the maintenance therapy was implemented with capecitabine, nivolumab, and bevacizumab. The benefits of this maintenance therapy were confirmed in August 2019 via the PET-CT which had recorded the complete metabolic response ( Figure 3 ). Considering the observed cutaneous toxicity of grade 2, hypothyroidism and venous thrombosis in the lower extremities, bevacizumab was discontinued in August 2019 and replaced with capecitabine. The entire treatment process has been shown in  Supplementary Figure 2 . As of March 2020, the patient had reached a PFS of more than 17 months since the initiation of the combined nivolumab/bevacizumab therapy. As the patient reported no adverse events during the treatment, so she is still administered nivolumab plus capecitabine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8112237/,4,images/PMC8/PMC811/PMC8112237_01
PMC6352649_01,PMC6352649,Male,80.0,"An 80-year-old male, from whom we obtain the consent form, during the follow-up for thymoma (previous thymectomy in 2011) and kidney cancer (previous nephrectomy in 2012), presented a solitary pulmonary nodule in the superior lobe of the right lung as detectable by means of 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan in December 2015 (injected dose 380 MBq). PET/CT images showed a metabolically active lesion (SUVmax 4.63 g/ml bw, 14 mm in diameter), suspected of being a metastasis [Figure 1]. Contrast-enhanced CT with iodinated contrast media performed after PET examination did not show significant attenuation between pre- and postcontrast phase [Figure 2]. After a right pulmonary resection in January 2016, bioptic diagnosis of the nodule was compatible with fibrotic (benign) pulmonary meningioma.
In June 2016, another 18F FDG PET/CT scan was performed in the same patient (injected dose 361 MBq) that showed another new metabolically active pseudonodular lesion (SUVmax 2.46 g/ml bw, 12 mm in diameter) in the superior lobe of the left lung [Figure 3]. A CT scan with iodinated contrast, the lesion showed enhancement at postcontrast phase [basal scan:-1 HU; postcontrast scan: 55 HU, Figure 4]. After an atypical resection of the superior lobe of the left lung in September 2016, biopsy showed a high proliferative activity with a number of mitotic figures >20/10 HPF, Ki-67   20%, with associated necrosis and on immunohistochemistry cells expressed epithelial membrane antigen and they were positive for vimentin and progesterone: the final diagnosis was anaplastic meningioma (malignant).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6352649/,4,images/PMC6/PMC635/PMC6352649_01
PMC8371243_01,PMC8371243,Male,68.0,"A 68-year-old man presented to a previous hospital with a diagnosis of acute heart failure. He had undergone prior surgical resection of papillary adenocarcinoma of the thyroid at 3 years before the current presentation. An echocardiogram showed a massive pericardial effusion, and pericardiocentesis was performed. After pericardial drainage, his symptoms, including shortness of breath and dyspnea, were significantly improved. Cytological analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed malignant epithelial cells consistent with the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an anterior mediastinal mass lesion invading the pericardium (Fig. 1A). CT also confirmed swelling of the mediastinal lymph nodes, bilateral pleural effusion, and pleural dissemination (Fig. 1B). He was therefore referred to our hospital with suspicious mediastinal metastasis of primary unknown malignancy. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was 69.2 ng/ml. A review of organ systems revealed a liver lesion, suggesting liver metastasis. However, no other suspicious primary lesions were found. For histological confirmation, a video-assisted thoracoscopic tumor biopsy was performed. In addition to an incisional biopsy of the mediastinal tumor, a biopsy of the lung pleural nodule was also performed.
Microscopic examination of both tumors showed that cuboidal cancer cells with mucin production proliferated in a fused glandular or small-nested pattern. Extracellular mucin pools and signet-ring-like cells were also noted (Fig. 2). These histological features were not similar to those of thyroid papillary adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, cancer cells are positive for cytokeratin (CK) 20 and caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX-2), and negative for CK7, estrogen receptor, CD5, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) (Fig. 3). The final diagnosis was primary thymic mucinous adenocarcinoma.
Because the tumor was unresectable, he received paclitaxel-carboplatin-based chemotherapy. Due to disease progression, carboplatin and pemetrexed were subsequently administered. However, 6 months after surgery, he died due to cancer progression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8371243/,3,images/PMC8/PMC837/PMC8371243_01
PMC3921830_01,PMC3921830,Male,25.0,"A 25-year-old man was admitted to the surgery unit in Italy in January of 2008 due to severe right flank pain with occurrence of gross hematuria, urinary frequency, and urodynia. The results of an abdominal ultrasound revealed a hypo-echoic area measuring 6x10 cm in the right renal collecting system. A CT scan was not routinely performed. On physical examination and chest X-ray, metastases were not found. Laboratory investigations and urinalysis revealed no abnormalities. The patient underwent a right nephrectomy with simultaneous removal of right adrenal gland. Macroscopic evaluation of the specimen revealed a polycystic tumor 10 cm in diameter. The histopathological diagnosis was: nephroblastoma with microscopic evidence of renal pelvis and renal sinus vessels neoplastic infiltration without crossing the renal capsule. The stage of disease was assessed as stage I according to the SIOP staging system. An adjuvant treatment was not performed after nephrectomy. The follow-up was conducted in the surgery center. In September 2008 (eight months after the surgery) computed tomography scanning revealed a lymph node enlargement measuring 2.5 cm in the area of the lower vena cava.
The patient was subsequently admitted to the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center, Gliwice Branch. He was in a good physical condition, but complained of fatigue and pain in the lumbar spine area. In a CT scan of the chest, the presence of two metastases was determined. One measuring 2.8 x 3.8 cm located above the diaphragm in the VIII segment of the right lung and the other one measuring 1.5 cm in diameter within the III segment of the left lung (Fig. 4, Fig. 4b). Several metastases ware observed also in chest X-ray in both lungs - a greatest at the base of the right lung (diameter 5.5 cm) (Fig. 5).
Consultation of histological slides was performed. The tumor was composed mostly of diffuse sheets of blastemal cells with irregular nuclei, numerous mitotic figures, and apoptotic bodies. Focally, there was a cord-like growth pattern and the stromal component was scared. Areas of necrosis were also seen (Figs. 1 & 2). Immunohistochemically, blastemal cells expressed WT1 and were CD 99 negative (Fig. 3). The final diagnosis was: nephroblastoma - blastemal type. The presence of vassal infiltration in the renal sinus (described in the first diagnosis) suggested stage II. The current stage of disease was assessed as stage IV according to the SIOP staging system.
In December 2008, the patient began receiving chemotherapy based on the CDVC scheme. He was given 450 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide during days 1-3, 50 mg/m2 of doxorubicin on day 1, 120 mg/m2 of vepesid on days 15-17, and 150 mg/m2 of carboplatin on days 15-17, in 28 days intervals. The treatment was continued for 34 weeks. Before each cycle the patient's condition was assessed according to the ZUBROD scale, physical examinations were done, and laboratory tests were conducted. Neutropenia stage IV according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) occurred after the first cycle of chemotherapy. Although the doses of cytostatics were reduced and prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia with granulocyte colony stimulating factors was applied, the patient experienced hematological complications after each cycle. Generally, he was given IV chemotherapy cycles. The control CT scan revealed disease progression in the form of new lymph node metastases in the mediastinum and in the hilum of the right lung (Fig. 6). Disease progression was also observed in chest X-ray (Fig. 7). The case was determined as chemo-resistant and chemotherapy treatment was terminated.
In July of 2009 a progression in the sizes of the metastases in both the lungs and the lymph nodes in the mediastinum and the abdominal cavity was observed. The metastasis in the retroperitoneal area gave rise to compression symptoms, pains in the right lumbar spine area, coughing, physical weakness, and swelling of the left testicle. The patient had surgical consultation in order to determine the possibility of surgical treatment of the tumor in the retroperitoneal area what turned out to be impossible. Therefore, palliative radiotherapy was given. Photons with beam energy of 20 MV were used in the area of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes in a fractional dose of 3 Gy to a total dose of 30 Gy per tumor. The clinical and imaging control examination revealed progression of the disease. The patient's physical condition worsened and pains in the lumbar spine area became more severe. The patient died in February of 2010, 13 months after the Wilms' tumor diagnosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3921830/,6,images/PMC3/PMC392/PMC3921830_01
PMC527873_01,PMC527873,Female,51.0,"A 51-year-old female was admitted on May 9, 1995, because of severe hematemesis. The patient had been treated elsewhere for one month for pain and redness of both breasts and fever (>= 38 C). There was no generalized lymphadenopathy. On gastroscopic examination multiple small ulcers were observed in the stomach. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan showed liver tumor and a normal spleen. Hematological and biochemical examination at admission showed the following results: RBC 352 x 104/mm3, hemoglobin 10.3 g/dl (post transfusion), WBC 4,900/mm3, Platelets 51,000/mm3, serum albumin 1.5 g/dl, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl, AST 691 IU/l, ALT 187 IU/l, LDH 2976 IU/l, fibrinogen 134 mg/dl, FDP 10 mug/ml, and AT-III 40%. Bleeding from the stomach continued and did not stop with conservative treatment; therefore, two days later the patient underwent total gastrectomy and a partial liver resection. Histopathology of the resected specimen showed it to be a gastric lymphoma (pleomorphic medium-large cell type, non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma) with liver metastasis (Fig. 1). From first postoperative day (POD), bleeding from the esophagojejunostomy continued; the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and died on 8th postoperative day.
On autopsy, malignant lymphoid cell infiltration and hemophagocytosis were observed in the liver, spleen, heart, small bowel, lung, both breasts, kidney, pancreas, uterus, and gastroduodenal lymph nodes (Fig. 2). The bone marrow presented hyperplasia and hemophagocytic macrophages but no infiltration by lymphoma cells. Immunohistochemically the neoplastic cells were positive for T-cell marker UCHL1 (CD45RO) and EBV by EBER in situ hybridization. The final diagnosis was EBV-related T-cell LAHS.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC527873/,2,images/PMC5/PMC527/PMC527873_01
PMC4193294_01,PMC4193294,Male,57.0,"A 57-year-old male presented with left parotid mass. The patient noticed the mass 3 weeks before the presentation. The mass was painless without overlying redness of the skin, fever or any drainage from the area. The patient had a past medical history significant for Lhermitte Duclos disease (dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum), arteriovenous malformation of vertebral artery in the cervical spine region, chronic sinus disease, hypothyroidism, hyperplastic gastric polyps, hamartomatous colonic polyps, kidney stones, benign kidney cysts, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and prostatic adenocarcinoma. Hamartam atous lesions diagnosed in this patient are consistent with the clinical syndrome of CS.
The patient was referred to radiologist for ultrasound guided biopsy. The ultrasound showed a heterogeneous, solid mass predominantly 1.9 cm x 1.6 cm x 1.4 cm with areas of isoechogenicity and hypoechogenicity within the superficial superior aspect of the left parotid gland. The mass appeared to be well circumscribed with minimal vascularity and no appreciable internal vascularity. In addition, regional ipsilateral cervical adenopathy along deep jugular vein was noted. A follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of the neck revealed a heterogeneous T1- and T2-weighted signal with an enlarged intraparotid lymph node worrisome for a neoplasm.
Fine needle aspiration was performed with ultrasound guidance and immediate adequacy triage. Three air dried Diff Quik, and three alcohol fixed Papanicolau stained smears were done. The aspirate smears showed moderate cellularity and were composed of epithelial cells clusters with microvesicular cytoplasm and small wrinkled nuclei identifiable as sebocytes. There were also foci of squamous metaplasia admixed with nonneoplastic salivary gland tissue in the background of abundant lymphocytes. There was no cytologic evidence of malignancy. The sebaceous cells differentiation was more evident in the air dried, Diff Quik smears. Intraprocedural differential diagnoses included sebaceous lymphadenoma, sebaceous adenoma and in addition other benign salivary tumors with sebaceous differentiation to be ruled out. The alcohol fixed Papanicoloau smears showed clusters of sebocytes (described above) admixed with lymphocytes in the background [Figures 1-4]. Foci of squamous metaplasia was identified. Flow cytometry was attempted on the specimen but proved to be inadequate.
The patient underwent left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Gross examination of the resected specimen revealed a yellow variegated well circumscribed mass measuring 2 cm x 1.9 cm x 1.5 cm. No discreet lymph node was noted in the submitted specimen.
Microscopically the tumor was well defined and mostly encapsulated with an epithelial cystic component and a lymphoid component. The epithelial component was composed of squamous and sebaceous differentiation with no significant atypia or evidence of malignancy. The lymphoid component was dense and showed reactive lymphoid follicles with germinal centers [Figures 5-6]. The parotid tissue outside the tumor area was unremarkable. Previous fine needle biopsy site was identified by granulation tissue and multinucleated giant cells within the mass.
The final diagnosis was sebaceous lymphadenoma. There was no history of recurrence at 20 months follow-up.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193294/,4,images/PMC4/PMC419/PMC4193294_01
PMC6642620_01,PMC6642620,Female,44.0,"A 44-year-old pregnant woman presented with a lump in the left breast and pedal edema. The patient was married from the past 2 years and it was a non-consanguineous marriage. She was a second gravida woman with intracytoplasmic sperm injection conception after 1 year of a previous abortion (conception by in vitro fertilization) a single live uterine pregnancy of 26 weeks (second trimester). She was a known case of hypertension and hypothyroidism, and was receiving nifedipine 10 mg OD and thyroxine 75 microg OD. Medical history showed the patient was anemic with low hemoglobin levels (10.7 gm%). Genotyping for BRCA1, BRCA2, or FANCJ was not performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of chest and abdomen (Jun 2018) showed a large soft tissue intensity irregular mass lesion with central necrosis with restricted diffusion measuring 6.1x5.5x5.0 cm in the inner quadrant of the left breast parenchyma with adjusted lobulated prominent ducts suggestive of left breast malignant mass. Multiple enlarged lymphnodes were seen in the left axillary region. Multiple tiny randomly distributed pulmonary nodules with restricted diffusion were observed suggestive of lung metastasis. Multiple mixed hyperintense necrotic, non-necrotic lesions with restricted diffusion of varying size (1.9-8 cm) were seen in both lobes of liver with the largest measuring 8x7 cm. Staging was done as T3N2M1 - Stage IV.
Biopsy from the left breast lump showed a tumor occupying 60% of the biopsy specimen. Tumor cells were arranged in a diffuse pattern; few glands and pseudo papillae with surrounding desmoplastic stroma were noted. Tumor cells showed moderate pleomorphic nuclei, coarse chromatin, and moderate cytoplasm. In addition, few benign ductules were noted. Frequent mitotic figures were reported (12/10 hpf). The impression was made as invasive carcinoma, no special type (NOS) (Figure 1).
Immunohistochemical examination showed negative estrogen receptor, weak positive progesterone receptor (10%), and negative HER2 neu status. The final diagnosis was PABC with lung and liver metastases. 2D ECHO with Color Doppler showed normal cardiac functions with an ejection fraction of 63%.
The patient was planned for palliative chemotherapy with 3-weekly NDLS based TAC (NDLS, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) regimen for six cycles. The first chemotherapy cycle was started in Jul 2018 with intravenous (IV) NDLS 100 mg (75 mg/m2), IV doxorubicin 80 mg, and IV cyclophosphamide 800 mg on Day 1 of the cycle along with IV ranitidine 50 mg BD, IV dexamethasone 8 mg BD, and IV ondansetron 8 mg BD. Filgrastim 300 microg was given subcutaneously on Days 2-4 of the cycle.
Ultrasound antenatal scan with Doppler done a day before the second chemotherapy cycle demonstrated a single live intrauterine fetus in cephalic presentation with fetal spine to the maternal right side. Active fetal movements and fetal cardiac pulsations were present with fetal heart rate measuring 132/min. Placenta was seen in fundal posterior and left lateral wall with grade II maturity. The average gestational age was 31 weeks and 5 days with normal Doppler parameters. After 3 weeks following the first chemotherapy cycle, a second cycle with NDLS based TAC regimen was administered similar to the first cycle.
At the 32nd week of gestation, the patient presented with the complaints of diminished fetal movements. There was no bleeding or prevaginal draining. Her amniotic fluid index was 7.2 cm. Medical oncologists' opinion was sought for emergency low segment cesarean section (LSCS). She was advised 6 units of fresh frozen plasma and 6 units of platelets transfusion. She was administered 4 doses of IV dexamethasone 6 mg at 6 hourly intervals. Emergency LSCS was performed, and intraoperative findings were normal. The patient delivered an alive male child. The child's birth weight was 1.76 kg which was normal as per the gestational age, and Apgar score was also normal. The child was kept for observation in the neonatal intensive care unit for 2 days as a precautionary measure. Tablet cabergoline 0.25 mg (two tablets) was given to the patient to suppress breast milk secretion. Her Hb level was 7.7 g%, and platelets were 182,000/mm3; 2 units of packed cell volume was administered, and the patient was asked to check and inform in case of any bleeding. The patient was advised to take plenty of oral fluids, salt-restricted diet, postnatal exercises, to avoid lifting heavy weight, and use of temporary contraception.
Her 3rd, 4th, and 5th chemotherapy cycles with NDLS based TAC regimen were given similar to previous cycles in Aug, Sep, and Oct 2018, respectively. The sixth chemotherapy cycle was given in Nov 2018 similar to the previous cycles except inj. filgrastim 300 microg OD for 3 days was replaced with inj. pegfilgrastim 6 mg OD on Day 2 of the cycle.
After completion of six chemotherapy cycles, MRI done in Nov 2018 showed a small focus of restricted diffusion measuring 8x7 mm noted in the inner quadrant of the left breast. There were no significantly enlarged mediastinal or axillary lymphnodes. Lung parenchyma showed normal densities with no evidence of alveolar densities, intrinsic thickening, fibrosis, or emphysematous changes - suggestive of no lung metastasis. Trachea and main bronchi were within normal limits. A few heterogeneous lesions with restricted diffusion were noted in the liver measuring 2.5x2 cm in segment VIII, suggestive of residual liver metastasis. A cystic lesion measuring 1.2x1.5 cm was noted in segment VIII of the liver. Overall, in comparison to the baseline MRI (Jun 2018; Figure 2) as per RECIST 1.1 criteria a ""partial response"" was reported with the NDLS based TAC chemotherapy regimen (Figure 3). Table 1 highlights pre- and post-NDLS based chemotherapy MRI findings. The patient is currently stable and receiving hormonal therapy with tamoxifen 20 mg PO.

PMC3884005_01,PMC3884005,Male,75.0,"A 75-year-old man was referred for abdominal computed tomography (CT) due to a poorly defined liver mass, detected by the primary care physician on ultrasound screening, which turned out to be a hemangioma. As an accidental finding, the contrast-enhanced CT scan additionally showed an 8 x 11 x 15 cm large retroperitoneal mass in the lower left abdomen adjacent to the sigmoid colon and the left psoas muscle (Figure 1A). The density measurements revealed that the thinly encapsulated mass consisted predominantly of fat with a few solid nodular structures. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the lesion to be composed predominantly of fat with a few solid hypervascularized nodules (Figure 1B and C). The mass was palpable through the abdominal wall but painless. Laboratory findings indicated a mild anemia (hemoglobin 12.9 g/dl) but were otherwise unremarkable. The patient had no history of malignant or infectious disease.
Due to the imaging findings, a retroperitoneal liposarcoma was suspected and the patient underwent surgery with resection of the mass and the adjacent sigmoid colon. Intraoperatively, the tumor showed firm adhesions both with the mesentery of the sigmoid colon as well as with the adjacent small bowel mesentery. During adhesiolysis, several tumor feeding vessel originating from the inferior mesenteric artery were identified and clamped. Due to the close proximity of the tumor to the sigmoid colon, the latter was resected en bloc together with the mass and a side-to-side descendo-rectostomy was performed. Macroscopic appearance as well as histology and immunohistochemistry of the mass are shown in Figure 2.
Macroscopic evaluation of the surgical specimen confirmed the predominance of fat within the thinly encapsulated tumor (Figure 2A). Histology demonstrated the presence of large-sized lipid vacuoles and small, disseminated islands of lipoblasts (Figure 2B). Variable-sized nests of epitheloid cells were spread over the tumor. Immunohistochemically, these cells showed only weak staining for melan-A, desmin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) (Figure 2C). S-100 staining was negative but strong reaction was found for human melanoma black HMB-45 (Figure 2D). MiB1 staining revealed a proliferation rate < 1% and no mitoses were observed. A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MDM2 gene amplification was negative, thus a liposarcoma was ruled out and the final diagnosis was lipid-rich perivascular epitheloid cell tumor (PEComa) without any signs of malignancy. The patient recovered well from surgery and did not require any further adjuvant treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3884005/,7,images/PMC3/PMC388/PMC3884005_01

It also extended inferiorly into the ethmoids, eroded the lamina papyracea, contacted the left medial rectus, and eroded the superior orbital wall (Fig. 3). She underwent an endoscopic biopsy that showed LGSSNMF and then underwent a craniofacial resection of the anterior skull base in combination with neurosurgery. Final pathology showed a tumor focally eroding the bone comprising monotonous spindle cells without cytological atypia that were positive for S100 and SMA, and negative for desmin, myf4, and the SYT gene translocation.

Physical examination revealed only splenomegaly. Color Doppler ultrasound indicated enlarged lymph nodes in the bilateral axillary, the left clavicle, and the right subclavian area. Positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) showed increased Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) metabolism in the lymph nodes aforementioned. An excision biopsy of the right axillary lymph node showed structure abnormality and the interfollicular area hyperplasia. Some medium-sized cells were found in the interfollicular area and the lymphatic sinuses, with moderate amount of cytoplasm, round or oval red-stained nuclei, and unclear nucleoli. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed as follows: MPO (+), CD68/PGM-1 (+), CD43 (+), CD56 (scattered+), CD20 (-), CD3epsilon (-), CD4 (-), CD8 (-), CD30 (-), CD99 (-), CD123 (-), EMA (-), ALK-1 (-), granzyme B (few+), TIA-1 (part+), EBER1/2 in situ hybridization (-) (Fig.1). Pathologists concluded myeloid sarcoma as the first diagnosis, considering the tumor cells expressed granulocyte and mononuclear system biomarkers. Further bone marrow smear, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and gene expression panel studies were negative, with a normal diploid karyotype. The final diagnosis was primary MS.
The patient received standard induction chemotherapy with DA regimen (daunorubicin 45 mg/m2, D 1-3; cytarabine 100 mg/m2, D 1-7). She achieved complete remission after the induction and had another 6 courses of DA regimen during the donor matching. No severe adverse events but myelosuppression and infections were observed after the first chemotherapy. She and her father had a 7/12 match at HLA-A, B, C, DR, DP, and DQ. Without an HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, the patient initiated microtransplantation. During the period, G-CSF mobilized hematopoietic stem cells from her father peripheral blood were obtained. She received mircotransplantation 24 hours after the third DA regimen in July 2014, with 98ml infusion in which the CD34+ cell dose was 1.1x106/L. The recovery of WBC and platelet was 10 and 11 days, respectively. She got the second microtransplantation after the fifth chemotherapy in September 2014, with 180ml infusion containing 1.9x10^6/L CD34+ cells. Without any GVHD prevention, there's no acute or chronic GVHD detected after each microtransplantation. Regular blood and bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD), ultrasound, CT, and PET/CT were performed to assess whether the patient achieved complete remission (CR). No abnormalities were found in these results until March 2020. She was admitted again for fever and fatigue. Physical examination revealed the enlarged bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes. Core needle biopsy showed the hematopoietic tissue proliferation, with the interfollicular area infiltrated by some medium-sized, medium-cytoplasm, and nucleus deformation cells.

The size of the swelling showed no association with increased intraperitoneal pressure. Physical examination revealed no evident defects in the appearance of the scrotum, with the exception of several hard, botryoidal masses, located between the left testicle and the inguinal region, with smooth surfaces and limited capacity of mobility. Ultrasound examination revealed several solid, well-demarcated, hypoechoic extratesticular masses arising from the left spermatic cord, the largest of which was ~3 x 2 cm in size. The masses were separated from the cutis and showed no connections with the left testis and epididymis, and no vascularity was observed. The patient's family signed an informed consent prior to the treatment.
A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple high-density nodules associated with the left spermatic cord, which showed partial fusion, uniform density and a clear boundary with the testis (Fig. 1). In addition, the density of the nodules was enhanced slightly and no bilateral inguinal swollen lymph nodes were observed in the enhanced scan.
The masses were removed by a left spermatic cord tumor resection via a left inguinal approach, under epidural anesthesia. Benign mesenchymal tissue was diagnosed by intraoperative frozen pathological sections. Postoperative pathological examination confirmed that the masses belonged to multiple mesenchymal tumors with classic properties, including fibroplasia, small vascular hyalinization, clear boundaries, less tumor component and no nuclear division. Immunohistochemical examination revealed the presence of numerous tumor markers, including CD99+, Bcl-2+, partial CD34+, focal S-100+, SMA+ and CD68- (Fig. 2).

PMC7146309_01,PMC7146309,Male,61.0,"A 61 years old man who was referred to our hospital complained of a palpable mass around the anus and appeared repeatedly in last 10 years.
The patient discovered the mass around his anus by himself 10 years ago. He underwent two major surgeries for resection of the mass by posterior approach. A palpable lesion appeared 2 months ago prior to admission into our hospital.
The patient was diagnosed with hypertension and took single dose of calcium channel blockers daily. His blood pressure was under control and well-managed.
A 2 cm mass was observed at the 12 o'clock direction in chest-knee position. Digital rectal examination determined the presence of a rubbery lesion located in presacral space. The mass was smooth and firm, and no nodule was felt on the surface. The mass was tender and the local skin temperature was slightly elevated.
Cell blood count revealed mild anemia with a hemoglobin count of 122 g/L along with normal white blood cell and platelet count. The blood biochemistries, hematological tumor markers, prothrombin, and partial thromboplastin were normal. Electrocardiogram, chest computed tomography, echocardiography and pulmonary function tests were also normal.
Before the first surgery in our hospital, pre-operative pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with intravenous Gadolinium highlighted a 6.8 cm * 5.2 cm * 7.3 cm mass located at presacral space. In contrast phase, the center of the lesion showed homogenous density and without enhancement (Figure 1A, white arrow). Before second surgery in our department, MRI showed a 3.2 cm * 7.2 cm * 5.8 cm mass located at presacral space (Figure 1B, black arrow). No enlargement of lymph nodes was observed. After gadolinium administration, the center of the lesion showed homogenous density without enhancement. This time however, we observed a speckled pattern enhancement on the margin surrounding the lesion. Due to the MRI finding, our differential diagnosis included presacral epidermoid cyst relapse, without exclusion of malignant tumor.
The treatment approach was surgical resection of the entire tumor via posterior para-sacral approach. A long star retractor was used to retract and expose the lesion. A negative pressure drainage tube was placed and removed on the seventh day post-surgery. The patient was discharged 1 week after surgery with full recovery and no fecal incontinence.
Pathological diagnosis of the resected tumor was benign presacral epidermoid cyst in the third surgery (Figure 2A, original magnification x100 and insert x400). Pathological finding in the latest surgery: a mass measured 8 * 5 * 3 cm, with the appearance of saclike, white to tan and necrotic. The final diagnosis was SCC (Figure 2B, original magnification x100 and insert x400). The patient completed standard pelvic radiation and 12 courses of chemotherapy. One year after his final surgery, enhanced pelvic MRI showed no signs of tumor recurrence (Figure 1C, the yellow dotted circle indicated the location of the previous mass). The patient was advised to come for regular follow-up visits for once a year during the first three-year post-surgery.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146309/,5,images/PMC7/PMC714/PMC7146309_01
PMC4531591_01,PMC4531591,Female,21.0,"A 21-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaint of febrile sensation developed 6 months previously. Initially, she was admitted to the department of rheumatology and went through many examinations for evaluation of fever of unknown origin. However, no definite diagnosis was made, except for splenomegaly and multiple, small-sized, paraaortic lymphadenopathy observed in abdominal CT, and elevated liver function test. Therefore, she was transferred to the department of hemato-oncology for further evaluation of fever, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Her past medical history and family history were unremarkable. On admission, her temperature was 38 C, pulse 90/min, respiration 18/min, and blood pressure 120/80 mmHg. The fever pattern showed early morning high peak, and normal body temperature was observed more than once in a day. Physical examination revealed that she was a chronically fatigue woman in no acute distress, and had an anemic conjunctiva. There was no evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy or abnormal findings in chest and bowel auscultation. Splenomegaly was palpable about 3-finger-breadths in the left upper quadrant, but there was no specific tender point. The laboratory evaluations were as follows: white blood cell count 2,400/muL (neutrophil 51.1%, lymphocyte 37%, monocyte 10.6%, basophil 0.7%, eosinophil 0.6%), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL, platelet count 147,000/muL, MCV 74.9 fL, and MCHC 32.2 g/dL. Serum iron level, total iron binding capacity and ferritin were within normal ranges. Serum electrolyte was also within the normal range, but albumin level was slightly below normal at 3.0 g/dL, cholesterol at 82 mg/dL, and AST/ALT was increased to 103/124 U/L. C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased to 4.3 mg/dL (normal: 0.1-0.8 mg/dL), prothrombin time percentage was 81% (normal: 0-70%), and partial thromboplastin time was 34 sec (normal: 26 sec). Hepatitis B surface antigen was negative with surface antibody positive. Urine analysis was within normal limits. Stool occult blood test showed negative findings. Chest X-ray, simple abdomen X-ray and electrocardiography were normal. Peripheral blood smear showed normocytic normochromic anemia pattern and revealed anisocytosis and poikilocytosis, but there was no evidence of malaria. Blood, urine and sputum culture were all negative. ANA titer was 1:40, with speckled type. ANCA, lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody were all negative. Complement 3 (C3) level was 147.0 mg/dL (normal: 79-152 mg/dL), and complement 4 (C4) 28.2 mg/dL (normal: 16-38 mg/dL). EBV (VCA) Ig M was negative, and Ig G to EBV was positive. Ig M to cytomegalovirus (CMV) was negative, and Ig G to CMV was positive. beta2-microglobulin was 2.3 mg/L (normal: 0-2.4 mg/L), and serum and urine immuno-electrophoresis were within normal limits. Bone marrow section was normocellular (50%) for her age with increased megakaryocytes. The myeloid series and the erythroid series were in normal proportion. Abdominal CT showed multiple, small-sized (below 1 cm), paraaortic, aortocaval, retrocaval lymphadenopathies, splenomegaly, and small amounts of ascites. We could not find a definite origin of fever, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in spite of many examinations after admission. Therefore, she was transferred to the department of general surgery to undergo diagnostic splenectomy. Operative findings revealed an enlarged spleen, measuring 24x13.5x6 cm and weighing 930 g. The outer surface was focally attached with fibrous tissue, but the capsule appeared intact and tense. On section, the cut surface was markedly congested with oozing, dark brownish blood. There were prominent white pulps on the cut surface. Microscopically, the spleen was markedly congested with dilatation of sinusoidal spaces. There were a few foci of nodular aggregates around the white pulp (Figure 1), which was composed mostly of atypical CD3 positive T lymphocytes, some of which were positive for EBV latent membrane protein (LMP) (Figure 2), P53, and KI-67 positive. B-cell markers (CD20 and CD79a) and CD56 were negative. The lymph node showed widening of the interfollicular T zone with infiltration of atypical large CD3, P53, and KI-67 positive T lymphocytes. Some of these were EBV LMP-1 positive. These cells were negative for CD56, CD30 and CD15. EBV polymerase chain reaction (EBV-PCR) with EBNA 1 primer showed a strong positive band at 138bp (Figure 3). In TCRgamma gene rearrangement, PCR amplification using primers Vgamma 1-8A, B/Jgamma, Jgamma 2, Vgamma 10/Jgamma 1, and Jgamma 2 showed monoclonal bands by 2% gel electrophoresis (Figure 4). These findings indicated the monoclonal nature of the lesion. After splenectomy, EBV (VCA) Ig G titer was extremely high (1:5120), confirming the final diagnosis of SCAEBV. The final diagnosis was made as SCAEBV infection with T-cell lymphoproliferative disease. She received CHOP (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, adriamycin 50 mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2, and prednisone 100 mg/day) chemotherapy. After starting CHOP chemotherapy, the fever was subsided. She received 6 cycles CHOP chemotherapy at postoperatively x months and at the time of writing had continued follow-up at our out patient department for 3 months without any definite symptoms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4531591/,4,images/PMC4/PMC453/PMC4531591_01

Ultrasonography (USG) abdomen showed large right suprarenal mass (9.5 cm x 8.8 cm x 12.5 cm) for which endocrinology referral was sought. The patient underwent multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) which includes unenhanced, early arterial (20 s), early venous (60 s), and delayed (15 min) phases. CECT [Figure 1] showed rounded right suprarenal mass with central areas of necrosis and had a size of 9.9 cm (maximum size on axial images). Mass showed heterogeneous contrast enhancement, and it showed bright enhancement in arterial phase (Hounsfield unit [HU]-158.2) with good washout (Absolute washout percentage - 70.1%). On biochemical evaluation, plasma metanephrines (44.1 pg/ml, normal range <180 pg/ml) and normetanephrines (30.4 pg/ml, normal range <180 pg/ml) were normal ruling out secretory pheochromocytoma. I131 metaiodobenzylguanidine scan was done to rule out the possibility of nonsecretory pheochromocytoma, which showed no significant uptake in the mass. On morning 8 am cortisol (13.85 mug/dl, normal range <30 mug/dl) and overnight dexamethasone suppression cortisol (0.8 mug/dl, normal range <1.8 mug/dl) ruled out the secretory adrenal cortical carcinoma. 18-flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) revealed [Figure 2] multiple hypermetabolic lesions at right adrenal mass (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax]: 4.52), lytic lesion in the left scapula (SUVmax: 4.46), and soft tissue mass (7.3 cm) noted in the left gluteal region eroding the left iliac bone, acetabulum, inferior pubic rami and possibly invading the hip joint (SUVmax-5.5). USG-guided biopsy from the adrenal and gluteal region was done. Both biopsy cores showed tumor cells arranged as nests separated by thin vascular septae. Cells were discohesive with central round nucleus and moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm on microscopy [Figure 3a]. On immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were positivity for TFE [Figure 3b] and epithelial membrane antigen (focal) and were negative for cytokeratin, synaptophysin, inhibin, melan-A, and PAX8 diagnostic of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). The final diagnosis was primary gluteal region ASPS with hypervascular adrenal metastasis.

PMC6612022_01,PMC6612022,Female,62.0,"A 62-year-old female was admitted to our Emergency Department with a chief complaint of left lower quadrant abdominal pain. The patient also complained of not having had bowel movements for several days before coming to the hospital. She had a history of hypertension controlled with medication she did not smoke and had no previous surgical or hospitalization history.
A mass was palpable in the lower left quadrant. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a poly-lobulated mass in the left abdomen emanating from the left colon (Fig. 1). Small to moderate pockets of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis were observed. Moderate-to-large amount of stool in the proximal colon suggested constipation and partial obstruction (Fig. 1). However, there was no significant bowel dilatation.
Colonoscopy revealed an obstructing tumor in the descending colon. During colonoscopy, superficial biopsies were taken which showed villous adenoma on top of the tumor. The patient was taken to the operating theater and underwent a left hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis of the colon without diverting ostomy. Upon surgical intervention, the tumor extended through the colon wall with pericolonic hemorrhage (Fig. 2) arising from the mesocolon. The pathologic evaluation revealed extension of the tumor with metastasis to local lymph nodes and with hemorrhage. The mass measured 7 cm in greatest dimension which on section was nodular and brown (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Tumor markers were elevated, including: cancer antigen 125 (CA125) at 165 (0-32 mg/ml). Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) was also elevated at 48 (0-31 U/ml). Postoperatively the patient did well, diet was advanced and she was discharged five days later. Two weeks later in the office visit, she was doing well.
Microscopically, the tumor was composed of cells with small nuclei and scant cytoplasm, having the appearance of lymphocytes. They were arranged in large packets - separated by fine fibrovascular septa, so there is an organoid architecture, but it is very subtle. Nuclear molding was not observed. A CD45 (lymphocyte common antigen) IHC stain was negative. There were also nests of cells with a squamous appearance with keratin pearl formation. The proliferation marker Ki-67 was stained and was almost 100% (Fig. 3). The squamous cells were positive for cytokeratin marker 5/6 (CK5/6), P40 marker and P63 marker (Fig. 4). These markers confirm squamous cell differentiation. Interestingly they were also positive for CDX2 staining (Fig. 4), which indicates these cells have intestinal differentiation. The lymph node metastases showed similar features to that in the colonic mass with both neuroendocrine and squamous cell features.
The final diagnosis was infiltrating large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with squamous cell carcinoma of the sigmoid colon. The histologic grade was G3, poorly differentiated.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612022/,7,images/PMC6/PMC661/PMC6612022_01
PMC3354360_01,PMC3354360,Male,16.0,"A 16-year-old male presented to the clinic with a 2-week history of intermittent headaches. There were no localizing signs or motor or sensory symptoms. The past history was significant only for known multiple enchondromatosis, which had been diagnosed at 15 years of age after a pathological fracture of the proximal phalanx of his right index finger. The lesions had been localized to the index and middle fingers of right hand in a ray distribution [Figure 1].
We obtained a noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan [Figure 2], which showed a nonspecific hypodense lesion in the right insular cortex. There was no hemorrhage, calcification, or significant perilesional edema. The patient was subsequently lost to follow-up and no further investigations could be performed at that point. Three years later, however, the patient was admitted following a road traffic accident. Noncontrast CT scan [Figure 3] was done and showed a subdural hematoma (SDH) over the left cerebral convexity. The previously identified lesion in the right insular cortex had increased in size. In addition, there were similar hypodense lesions in the left basifrontal region and the left precentral gyrus.
The patient underwent an emergency craniotomy for the SDH. A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) done 1 week later [Figure 4] showed an additional smaller lesion in the right cingulate gyrus. None of these lesions showed contrast enhancement. The possibility of multifocal gliomas was raised. The patient subsequently underwent biopsy of the left high frontal lesion. The initial pathology report, based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, showed mild focal increase in cellularity within the sampled tissue [Figure 5]. There was no conclusive evidence of a glioma. Immunohistochemical staining for mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) was subsequently performed and came back positive in the areas of increased cellularity. The final diagnosis was diffusely infiltrative low-grade glioma.
Follow-up MRI after 6 months did not show any significant change in the lesions. The patient is being planned for radiotherapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3354360/,3,images/PMC3/PMC335/PMC3354360_01
PMC8813629_01,PMC8813629,Female,43.0,"A 43-year-old female was referred for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of two lumps in the left breast noticed 4 months back. On examination, there was a lump in the upper outer quadrant, 3 cm in diameter while another lump was felt in the central quadrant, 6 x 5 cm in size. The larger lump was smooth, soft to firm in consistency. It was not fixed to the overlying skin or underlying muscle. Mammogram was reported as BIRADS 3. An USG-guided FNA was performed from both the lumps. Cytologic features of the FNA from the larger lump are shown in Figures 1a and 1b. FNA findings from the smaller lump are shown in Figures 1c and 1d.
What is the cytological interpretation on FNA smears of the larger lump?
Cystic lesion with squamous metaplasia
Squamous metaplasia secondary to infarcted fibroadenoma
Infarcted phyllodes tumor with squamous metaplasia
Squamous cell carcinoma of the breast
The correct cytological interpretation is:
a. Cystic lesion with squamous metaplasia.
USG-guided FNA from the smaller lump (upper outer quadrant) showed features of proliferative breast disease with the presence of stromal fragments and clusters of ductal epithelial cells showing focal mild anisonucleosis in a background of bipolar myoepithelial cells [Figure 2a]. FNA smears from the larger lump (central quadrant) showed a few inflammatory cells, an occasional cluster of benign squamous cells and histiocytes. Diligent search failed to reveal any features suggestive of malignancy. Hence, a cytological impression of proliferative breast disease with cystic change and squamous differentiation was rendered. In view of the patient's age, size of the lump and mild anisonucleosis in aspiration smear, a core biopsy was performed. The core biopsy of the larger lump showed benign breast tissue and a tiny island of neoplastic squamous cells that were negative for CK7. In view of the suspicious features on core biopsy, a modified radical mastectomy was performed. The excised specimen showed a large mass with central cystic zone occupying almost the entire breast parenchyma with unremarkable skin, nipple, and areola.
Histopathological examination revealed features of a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) comprising almost 100% of the tumor area [Figure 2b]. One of the ducts in this area had metaplastic squamous lining displaying transition to frank SCC [Figure 2c]. The peripheral areas of the mass showed fibroadenomatoid change with foci of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and focal ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) adjoining the areas of SCC. On immunohistochemistry, the tumor was triple-negative (estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], and Her2neu) as well as negative for CK7 while being positive for pan-CK and CK5/6 [Figure 2d]. A thorough clinical examination and follow-up positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) scan failed to detect any other primary site; hence, the final diagnosis was rendered as primary squamous cell carcinoma of breast (SCCB) with coexisting spectrum of proliferative breast disease encompassing ADH and DCIS. The patient was referred for chemotherapy. She was negative for relapse or distant metastasis during 12 months follow-up.
Infiltrating duct carcinoma of breast
Fibrocystic disease of the breast
Proliferative breast lesion
Ductal carcinoma in situ.
Q1. The cytomorphologic features on FNA of smaller breast lump are suggestive of: 
Q2. On immunohistochemistry of a breast lesion, which of the following suggest a diagnosis of SCC?

PMC8821965_01,PMC8821965,Male,63.0,"A 63-year-old man was admitted to our Department of Nephrology for further investigation of massive proteinuria. He had a 2-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and splenomegaly. At 1 month before admission, the patient was diagnosed with T-LGLL accidentally when he was experiencing an exacerbation of upper respiratory tract infection (fever of 38.2 C with cough and sputum), with a lymphocyte count of 5.68 x 109/L showing the presence of specifically large lymphocytes containing granules and a flow cytometry analysis showing a CD2+/CD3+/CD4-/CD7+/CD8+/CD57+/TCRalphabeta+ phenotype. The bone marrow TCR gene analysis showed a rearrangement of TCRB and TCRG gene clones. At that time, the serum creatinine (SCr) was 90 mumol/L, whereas he developed progressive edema and proteinuria 10 days later.
On admission, the patient complained of anorexia. Upon physical examination, it was found that the blood pressure was at 180/100 mmHg. There was severe edema, no rash, no palpable superficial lymph nodes, and no sign of livedo reticularis indicating cryoglobulinemia. The laboratory examination revealed acute kidney injury in that SCr was rapidly elevated to 327 mumol/L, with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 63.69 mmol/L, BUN to SCr ratio  60:1, uric acid at 714 mumol/L, and albumin at 30.4 g/L (40-55). The complete blood count results were as follows: WBC, 5.4 x 109/L; Hb, 96 g/L; reticulocyte, 176.3 x 109/L (24-84); platelet, 76 x 109/L; neutrophil, 10.7%, 0.6 x 109/L (1.8-6.3); and lymphocyte, 84.8%, 6.8 x 109/L (1.1-3.2). The urinalysis found microscopic hematuria at 4-7 cells/HPF, the 24-h urinary protein was at 10.85 g, the 24-h urinary sodium was at 12.75 mmol, and the filtered sodium excretion fraction was at 0.2%. The tests for antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, anti-GBM antibodies, hypocomplements (C3 and C4), and cryoglobulin did not detect their presence; the anti-cyclic citrulline polypeptide antibody was at 140 RU/ml (<5), and antistreptolysin O (ASO) was 235 IU/ml (<220). However, the systemic inflammatory response was mild (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 28 mm/h; hypersensitive C-reactive protein, 13.2 mg/L). The CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, enlarged kidneys, and spleen as well as a large amount of peritoneal effusion.
The renal pathological findings showed that the glomeruli were negative for IgG, IgA, C1q, FRA, ALB, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, with IgM+ and C3+++ being positive and granularly depositing in the mesangial area by immunofluorescence analysis. Under light microscope observation, there were 21 global ischemic sclerosis of a total of 59 glomeruli, which were mainly distributed beneath the renal capsule. The non-sclerotic glomeruli had an appearance of diffuse endocapillary proliferation. Most heteromorphic lymphocytes and a small number of neutrophils were observed in the intra-glomerular capillaries ( Figure 1 ). No structure of glomerular crescent and arteriolitis were detected. There was focal tubular necrosis, multifocal lymphocytes, and mononuclear cells inundates with interstitial fibrosis; however, tubulitis was not found. Under electron microscope observation, segmental low-density electron-dense deposition was disclosed limitedly in the mesangial area with the extensive fusion of podocyte foot processes, and no crystal or special microstructure was observed. Furthermore, the immunohistochemistry staining verified that the infiltrated heterotypic lymphocyte intra-glomerular capillaries expressed CD20-/CD3+/CD4-/CD8+/TCRbeta-/TIA1+/GranzymeB+/CD2-/CD7+/CD56-/Ki67 5%, demonstrating a cytotoxic T cell immunophenotype ( Figure 2 ). The above-mentioned findings of renal pathology suggested endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis associated with T-LGLL. Moreover, considering the history of recent respiratory infection, increased ASO, and C3 deposition in the mesangial area, infection-related glomerulonephritis could not be excluded. The extremely decreased FeNa indicated intra-glomerular hypoperfusion, which could contribute to aggravated tubular injury and kidney function loss. In addition, lymphocyte and monocyte ( Figure 1C  and  Figure 2 ) interstitial infiltration was revealed in histology, proving that tubulointerstitial injury might also be involved in the pathogenesis of the kidney injury.
Supportive therapy was initiated after the patient was admitted to our hospital, including hemodialysis and transfusion of platelet and plasma, while the levels of SCr and BUN continued to increase as shown in  Figure 3 . The peripheral levels of platelet (68-93 x 109/L) and neutrophil (0.4-1.4 x 109/L) remained low. The coagulation function test revealed prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (35-40 s) and decreased fibrinogen (1.65-2 g/L), strongly suggesting the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Immunosuppressive therapy was denied by the patient after the final diagnosis was confirmed. He chose to transfer to a local hospital where supportive treatment was sustained and unfortunately died a few days later.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8821965/,1,images/PMC8/PMC882/PMC8821965_01
PMC8523104_01,PMC8523104,Male,70.0,"This case was a 70-year-old patient who had a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), symptomatic of dyspnea and congestive heart failure. At that time, his AF was converted by electrical cardioversion with resolution of his symptoms. A year later, he presented with several months' history of progressive and marked dyspnea with minimal exertion. He underwent regadenoson MPI for cardiac evaluation. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm, first degree atrioventricular (AV) block, and T wave inversion in the inferolateral leads suggestive of myocardial ischemia (Figure 1). His MPI demonstrated mildly decreased LV ejection fraction of 49% without evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction; however, significant LV calcification (Figure 2) was observed on the low-dose CT used for attenuation correction during MPI.
Subsequently, other imaging studies, including chest x-ray, echocardiography, and chest CT, were obtained for further evaluation. The chest x-ray (Figure 3) showed extensive cardiac calcification, and the echocardiogram (Figure 4) revealed significant calcification of mitral valve annulus, LV septum, and mid free wall. However, his chest CT (Figure 5) revealed massive myocardial calcification involving only LV and its overlaying pericardium.
The patient had no past history of malignancy, endocrine disorder, tuberculosis, or recent traveling to other countries. Extensive laboratory evaluation revealed elevated NT-proB-type Natriuertic Peptide (1113.5 pg/ml; normal < 100 pg/ml) and C-reactive protein (1.21 mg/ dL, normal < 0.5 mg/dL), but normal findings of complete blood count, basic chemistry profile, troponin-I, sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody, antimitochondrial antibody, serum calcium/phosphate level, vitamin D level, and thyroid and parathyroid hormone levels. His echocardiography showed: (1) normal LV systolic function with calcification in the LV septum, mid free wall and mitral valve annulus (Figure 4) and normal right ventricular (RV) size and systolic function; (2) moderate bi-atrial enlargement with mild mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation; and (3) severe pulmonary hypertension and LV diastolic dysfunction. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated: (1) no angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease; (2) moderately severe pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 67 mmHg; (3) elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, measured at 28 mmHg; (4) elevated LV end-diastolic pressure, measured 29 mmHg; and (5) no evidence of ventricular interdependence on simultaneous LV/RV pressure measurement.

PMC7506053_01,PMC7506053,Female,33.0,"A 33-year-old female patient was admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery in September 2013 due to repetitive episodes of loss of consciousness for a few weeks. The patient reported no other symptoms. For the past 6 years, she was on immunosuppressive treatment due to ulcerative colitis (at the beginning azathioprine and sulfasalazine (2 years), and next mesalazine). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the head revealed the tumor present in the lateral part of the left temporal lobe and the cerebellum (Figure 1). After the total resection of the tumor, the samples were histopathologically evaluated. At the same time, a computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed diffuse tumorous lesions in the lungs. After resection, a biopsy was performed on one of the lesions.
Frozen section of the lesion resected from the right lung was examined (No 18502/13). The specimen was measuring 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in size, which showed the presence of whitish-gray nodules. The cross-section of the specimen revealed irregular and slightly brown infiltration. On microscopic examination, the specimen revealed bronchopneumonia with focal necrosis and fibrosis of the lung, which raised the suspicion of lymphoma. However, on further evaluation of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections, we observed many irregular necrotic areas, as well as fibrinous exudate with many macrophages and a few neutrophils in the alveoli (Figures 2A-C). We also observed sparse giant multinucleated cells, lymphocytic infiltration around the blood vessel, and necrotic areas together with focal fibrosis. In some blood vessels, thrombi including organized ones were also revealed. Additional staining methods, namely, van Gieson, Warthin-Starry, and azan were performed. Necrotizing pneumonia was ultimately diagnosed.
Samples obtained from the posterior part of the left temporal lobe of the brain (No: 13727) were small grayish and around 0.5-1 cm in size. On microscopic examination, multiple focal points of infiltrations composed mainly of small T cells (CD3+) and macrophages (CD68+) with dispersed giant cells of Reed-Sternberg morphology were observed (Figures 3A-C). The following immunophenotype of the aforementioned cells were revealed: CD45 (+, weaker than in T cells), CD30 (+, strong cytoplasmic and membranous), CD15 (+/-, weak cytoplasmic and in Golgi system in some cells), PAX5 (+, slightly weaker than in B cells), CD20 (+, membranous, weaker than in B cells), OCT (+/-, strong nuclear on the majority of the cells), BOB1 (-/+, trace in single cells), CD10 (-), Bcl6 (-), ALK1 (-), CD3 (-), S100 (-), and CD1a (-). Prognostic markers on Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells were as follows: Bcl2 (+, cytoplasmic, weaker than T cells), Ki67 (+, strong in almost all HRS cells), and CD68 (+++) in many concomitant macrophages (category 3) (Figures 3D,E). Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) of the CNS, mixed cellularity subtype (MCcHL) was diagnosed.
The samples from the brain were consulted and the diagnosis was confirmed. Correlation between the reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with the positive EBV/LMP1 immunostaining was emphasized (Figure 3F). Subsequently, the samples from the lung were reevaluated. A few slightly larger B cells (CD20+, CD30+, CD15-, and EBV/LMP1+) admixed with T cells (CD3+) were found (Figures 2D-F). The final diagnosis was changed to grade 1 LYG with lung involvement. In trephine biopsy (No: 30601/13) lymphomatous infiltration of the bone marrow was not observed.
Evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid showed no abnormalities. The patient was HIV negative. The following systemic polychemotherapy was introduced: BEACOPP+ DepoCyte  2 courses), radiotherapy (30 Gy), and CHOP (2 courses). Subsequently, complete regression of lesions in the CNS and lungs was confirmed by a positron emission tomographic (PET) scan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7506053/,13,images/PMC7/PMC750/PMC7506053_01
PMC10076618_01,PMC10076618,Male,73.0,"A 73-year-old Chinese male patient presented with a 6-month history of pruritic papules on the bilateral groin. The most potent steroid and antifungal ointments did not improve the eruptions before he sought evaluation at our hospital. The medical history was significant for a cerebral infarction. There was no family history of similar complaints. The dermatologic examination revealed multiple gray-white or dark red hyperkeratotic papules on a brown background on the bilateral groin. On closer examination, the hyperkeratotic papules had a verrucous appearance, some of which had coalesced. The papules were slightly hard on palpation (Figure 1). There were no abnormalities involving the axillae or perianal folds.
The possible diagnosis included viral warts, seborrheic keratoses, Bowenoid papulosis, Hailey-Hailey disease, Darier disease, confluent and reticulated papillomatosis, granular parakeratosis, and Langerhans histiocytosis. A skin biopsy was performed and revealed the following: the stratum corneum showed highly compact hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis with basophilic granules; the epidermis showed obvious acanthosis with psoriasiform hyperplasia; and lymphocytes infiltrated around small vessels in the upper dermis (Figure 2). A fungal microscopic examination and culture were negative. Based on clinical manifestations and histopathologic features, the final diagnosis was verrucous GP. The skin lesions improved after 1 month of a topical glucocorticoid and tretinoin cream. There was no recurrences after 6 months of follow-up.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10076618/,5,images/PMC1/PMC100/PMC10076618_01
PMC8769395_01,PMC8769395,Male,58.0,"A 58-year-old patient with no medical history was brought to our emergency department with sudden onset of deterioration of consciousness. Physical examination revealed right paresis and global aphasia. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 13 out of 42. CTA and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images showed acute cerebral infarction due to left middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Endovascular thrombectomy was performed and subsequent imaging showed successful revascularization (Fig. 1). Postoperative MRI showed diffuse infarction of the left hemisphere. Since the embolic source was unknown, the patient was kept under 24-hour monitor surveillance, had a Holter electrocardiogram (ECG), and underwent transthoracic echocardiogram, but no cardiogenic embolic source was revealed. The entire aorta was normal and showed no atherosclerotic change on CTA imaging. TEE revealed a pedunculate tumor-like lesion on the proximal ascending aorta (Fig. 2). The lesion was highly mobile and approximately 7 mm in size. Cardiac CT showed a corresponding contrast medium filling defect (Fig. 3). This finding was not detected on the CTA taken 2 days before. AMT was suspected, and surgical removal was planned 1 month after hospitalization. We started anti- coagulant therapy with heparin followed by bridging therapy with warfarin (controlled within 2.0-3.0 international normalized ratio). Follow-up TEE was performed 3 weeks after admission, and showed complete resolution of the thrombus (Fig. 4). During this period, there was no sign of symptomatic embolism. Cardiac CT was also performed and revealed the same result. An additional CTA was performed to rule out peripheral embolism, but there were no signs of occluded arteries. Based on the radiological and histological results and the clinical course, the final diagnosis was AMT. The operation was suspended and the patient was kept on anticoagulants. He had no recurrent lesion on TEE or cardiac CT at the 6-week follow-up (Fig. 4) and was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8769395/,8,images/PMC8/PMC876/PMC8769395_01
PMC5369260_01,PMC5369260,Female,43.0,"A 43-year-old female with a significant history of chronic neck pain, migraine, and coronary artery disease presented acutely with marked exacerbation of chronic neck pain and headache. When initially seen, she was neurologically intact. While awaiting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain and cervical spine, she was found unresponsive and pulseless and required full cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The cervical MRI documented a C1-3 intradural, extramedullary, ventrolateral mass nearly filling the spinal canal resulting in severe compression of the upper cervical cord. Marked cord edema, seen on the T2 image, was present from C5 through the medulla [Figure 1]. Following resuscitation, the patient was awake and alert, but was found to be quadriplegic, exhibiting no movement of sensation in all four extremities. She was immediately placed on intravenous steroids and taken to the operating room for a C1-3 decompressive laminectomy and gross total resection of the tumor [Figure 2]. The pathological diagnosis proved to be consistent with an ATRT [Figures 3-5].
Immediately postoperatively, the patient remained quadriplegic. However, on the postoperative day 12, she began moving the digits of the right hand and toes on the right side. She continued to exhibit poor respiratory effort and remained intubated for 14 days, subsequently requiring tracheostomy and gastrostomy. After 36 days of inpatient care, the patient was discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Upon discharge, she began a course of 28 fractions of radiation therapy for a total dose of 5040 cGy; she finished the radiation therapy 7 weeks later. Because of low performance status, she was no deemed a suitable candidate for chemotherapy.
Twelve weeks postoperatively, she had regained antigravity strength in both the upper extremities and was able to feed herself. She also demonstrated gross movement in both the lower extremities in all muscle groups, however, this was still deemed nonfunctional strength. The subsequent cervical MRI at four months postopertive revealed no recurrent disease. At 6 months, the patient remained in a nursing home with a stable neurological exam.
[Figures 3 and 5] Histopathological examination of the intradural, extramedullary, cervical spine tumor showed sheets of polygonal cells separated into small groups by a network of endothelial cell-lined capillaries. The tumor cells showed the characteristic rhabdoid appearance with an eccentric vesicular nucleus, prominent nucleolus, and the typical eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion. Electron microscopic examination of rhabdoid cells showed whorled aggregates of intermediate filaments making up the pink cytoplasmic inclusions seen in the hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) section. Immunohistochemical analysis depicted the typical immunophenotype of ATRT with loss of the nuclear INI1 (SMARCB1) staining, whereas staining positive for epithelial muscle antigen (EMA), vimentin, and smooth muscle antigen. In addition, the expected focal INI1 staining was positive in the surrounding endothelial cells and infiltrating leukocytes. The final diagnosis was ATRT [Figures 1 and 5].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5369260/,2,images/PMC5/PMC536/PMC5369260_01
PMC7490430_01,PMC7490430,Female,30.0,"A 30-year-old woman presented with fever and pain in her left flank. Initially, she was diagnosed with acute left pyelonephritis. Urine culture identified the presence of Escherichia Coli with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) resistance. At this point in time, the patient did not know that she was pregnant; her last menstrual period (LMP) LMP had occurred approximately 4 weeks previously. Initial evaluation by KUB films revealed a left kidney stone that was approximately 3 cm in diameter (Figure 1A). Ultrasonography of the urinary system showed moderate hydronephrosis of the left kidney along with a left renal pelvic stone that was approximately 3 cm in diameter (Figure 1B). Ultrasonography of the bladder revealed there was a gestational sac in the uterus (Figure 1C). Consideration of her LMP indicated that the patient was 4 weeks into pregnancy. Therefore, the final diagnosis was an infected left kidney stone (3 cm in diameter) during pregnancy. We had two possible plans: to remove the stone on the basis of obstruction and infection, or diversion alone. Following discussion between the obstetrician and the patient, we decided upon active management. We chose to carry out retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) in different stages.
To avoid complications associated with the anesthetic, the patient was scheduled for surgery once the infection had cleared and she had entered the second trimester of pregnancy. At the time of surgery, preoperative urine culture was sterile. However, intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis (Meropenem; dose in accordance with the sensitivity of the first infection) was administered prior to the procedure. The procedure was performed by an experienced urologist who had carried out over 1000 cases involving flexible ureteroscopy. The procedure began with semi-rigid ureteroscopy to evaluate the ureteral lumen. An ureteral access sheath (UAS; 11/13Fr) was selected and positioned without force and using the stiff guidewire. We estimated the length of UAS required to reach the upper ureter. This procedure was successfully completed using a non-pre-stented ureter. We then confirmed that the UAS was positioned appropriately by direct visualization with a flexible ureterorenoscope. The procedure was then carried out with a radiation-free protocol without fluoroscopy. We also ensured that ultrasound was available in the operating theatre if needed.
The stone was broken into fragments with a Ho-YAG laser lithotripsy (Versapulse, Lumenis ) and the fragments were removed in a basket; the laser was set to 1 Joule and 20 Hertz. During the procedure, we used the lowest possible irrigation flow to achieve an acceptable level vision (Figure 2). Due to concerns relating urosepsis, we restricted the operative time to 60 minutes. The residual stone was left in situ for the second stage of surgery. An ureteral stent (6Fr) was inserted after surgery owing to the presence of the residual stone, a history of urinary tract infection, the application of a UAS, and the need to reduce postoperative pain in high-risk groups. Although the surgery was performed safely in accordance with strict guidelines, the patient developed postoperative fever but responded fully to antibiotics (Meropenem). Subsequent stone cultures were positive for E. coli, as seen previously with urine cultures from the first infection. In total, three sessions of RIRS were required to fully remove the stone; these operations took place while the patient was 18-29 weeks pregnant (Figure 3). We removed approximately 30% of the stone during each session of RIRS; these restrictions were caused by issues related to time and irrigation flow. In the second and third operations, we used a larger UAS (12/14 Fr), without insertion difficulty or ureteric injury. There were no perioperative complications after the second and third procedures. The patient remained in hospital for a total of 3 days. The fetus was monitored by an obstetrician at each stage of the surgery and was in good health both before and after the surgical intervention. The ureteral stent was removed 2 weeks after the final procedure. During the remainder of the pregnancy, we used ultrasound to monitor for stones and hydronephrosis; there were no residual stones and no evidence of hydronephrosis when evaluated 2 and 6 weeks after the final surgery.
Nine weeks after the final surgery (at a gestational age of 37 weeks), the patient developed hypertension without proteinuria. She was subsequently diagnosed with pre-eclampsia without severe features. The pregnancy was then terminated by caesarian section and a male infant was delivered without complications. Four months after the final surgery, we used KUB films to check that the patient remained stone-free (Figure 4). Analysis of the stone indicated the presence of calcium phosphate (major) with calcium oxalate monohydrate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7490430/,3,images/PMC7/PMC749/PMC7490430_01
PMC4821153_01,PMC4821153,Female,30.0,"A 30-year-old Albanian female patient was referred to our hospital for living donor kidney transplantation. She was unable to walk without help and was restricted to a wheelchair. Her medical history included chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, anemia, and hepatitis C. She had been undergoing dialysis three times per week for 19 years. A tumor was protruding through her oral cavity; it had appeared insidiously 10 years ago and had increased gradually in size. The lesion was fixed to the underlying mandible, was tender to the touch, and was covered with oral mucosa. The teeth were severely affected, and bleeding sites were observed on the fragile mucosa (fig. 1). The patient had functional problems with chewing and speech. Serum chemistry revealed an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 2,930.6 pg/dl (normal range, 15-65 pg/dl), serum calcium 9.08 mg/dl (normal range, 8.8-11 mg/dl), phosphorus 4.2 mg/dl (normal range, 2.5-5.0 mg/dl), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 1,753 IU/l (normal range, 65-300 IU/l).
A sagittal magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head showed a brown tumor originating from the mandibular and maxillary bones (fig. 2). Ultrasonography of the neck revealed no parathyroid mass; however, a scan with 20 mCi Tc-99-sestamibi showed increased uptake by the parathyroid glands (fig. 3). Based on the medical history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests, the final diagnosis was brown tumor with HPT. A whole-body scan with 20 mCi Tc-99m-HDP was performed to look for multifocal disease, which may have been missed. However, only maxillary and mandibular accumulation was observed.
A total parathyroidectomy was performed without implantation of a parathyroid fragment into the forearm muscle. PTH was monitored intraoperatively, and the PTH level decreased (355 pg/dl). A histopathological examination of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma. Serum PTH level continued to decrease after surgery, and the laboratory findings 1 month postoperatively were PTH 127.2 pg/dl, ALP 247 IU/l, calcium 8.4 mg/dl, and phosphorus 2 mg/dl.
The lesion failed to regress 6 months postoperatively, despite optimal treatment for HPT. Kidney transplantation was performed with a living donor kidney from her cousin and creatinine levels decreased to normal postoperatively. No complications were observed during the first postoperative week, and the patient was discharged from the hospital.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4821153/,3,images/PMC4/PMC482/PMC4821153_01
PMC6434167_01,PMC6434167,Male,70.0,"A 70-year-old man presented to a local physician for cough in July 2018. As his symptom was not improved after more than one month, he visited another hospital. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed thickening of the bronchovascular bundle and stenosis at the introitus of the middle lobar branch (Fig. 1A and B). Bronchoscopy showed several endobronchial nodular protrusions and bronchial thickening along the right middle bronchus (Fig. 2A and B). The extent of the tumor margin was clearly identified as a magenta image by an autofluorescene imaging bronchovideoscope system (Fig. 2C).
He was suspected of having small cell lung cancer and therefore referred to our hospital for a further evaluation in August 2018. There were no changes or discontinuation of oral drugs or inhaled medicine. The patient was a current smoker (1 pack/day for 50 years) and had no known history of dust exposure, including asbestos. Laboratory test results were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC), 6100/mm3; hemoglobin, 14.3 g/dL; platelets, 26.0 x 104/mm3; serum total protein, 7.0 g/dL; albumin, 3.8 g/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL; lactate dehydrogenase, 148 IU/L; C-reactive protein, 0.19 mg/dL; soluble IL2-receptor, 384 U/mL; carcinoembryonic antigen, 1.8 ng/mL; pro gastrin-releasing peptide, 63.55 pg/mL; and neuron-specific enolase, 7.3 ng/mL. Autoimmune antibodies were negative, and free triiodo thyronine, free thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were within normal ranges. He underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomograghy (PET)/CT, which showed a mild FDG uptake (standardized uptake value [SUV] max 4.60) within the introitus of the right middle lobe bronchus but no other findings (Fig. 1C).
Bronchoscopy was performed again to obtain sufficient material to confirm the pathological diagnosis, and the endobronchial lesions were found to have regressed while the mucosal surface appeared relatively regular without atrophy or stenosis. (Fig. 2D-F). Histology of an endobronchial biopsy specimen showed diffuse infiltrates of small-sized atypical lymphoid cells within the mucosa. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated predominance of CD20- and CD79a-positive and CD5-negative lymphocytes, indicating a diagnosis of MALT lymphoma. We then performed sleeve lobectomy of the right middle lobe. The bronchus intermedius was divided at the level just proximal to the right upper lobe, and the right inferior lower lobe bronchus was divided distal to the bronchus intermedius. The bronchus intermedius was anastomosed to the right inferior lower bronchus after removal of the middle lobe. Regarding macroscopic findings, a protruded lesion (10 x 5 mm) was seen at the introitus of the middle lobar branch (Fig. 3). Frozen sections were analyzed, and the margins were negative. A pathological examination showed the diffuse infiltrate of small-to medium-sized lymphoid cells in the mucosa (Fig. 4A and B). Small lymphocytes had invaded the epithelial structures of the glands forming lymphoepithelial lesions. The lymphoid cells were positive for CD20 and negative for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) (Fig. 4C and D). A fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis to detect API2-MALT1 translocation was positive. These findings were compatible with the endobronchial biopsy findings. The final diagnosis was low-grade B cell MALT lymphoma. The patient has been followed without any additional treatment and has remained free of recurrence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6434167/,1,images/PMC6/PMC643/PMC6434167_01
PMC4895073_01,PMC4895073,Male,47.0,"A 47-year-old man presented with a rapidly enlarging left neck mass. He subsequently developed hoarseness, and difficulty swallowing solid foods, and weight loss of 30 pounds over 6 months. No other significant symptoms were present. Relevant past medical history included 30 pack-years of cigarette smoking. Given the rapid development of local symptoms, the primary care team initially managed the patient for a provisional diagnosis of lymphadenitis with a combination of antibiotics and steroids. This treatment failed to relieve the patient's symptoms or reduce the size of the mass. On subsequent referral to this institution, examination confirmed a palpable large left neck mass that was clinically inseparable from the thyroid gland; there was no appreciable lymph node enlargement. Flexible endoscopic examination revealed swelling and obstruction of the left piriform fossa without ulceration. The vocal cords were normal but the larynx was displaced to the right. A fine needle aspiration (FNA) at the outside hospital demonstrated atypical cells, possibly consistent with a low-grade cystic squamous cell carcinoma.
The patient proceeded to a staging FDG PET/CT and repeat FNA of the mass. The FDG PET/CT study was performed sixty minutes following the intravenous administration of 300 MBq (8 mCi) of 2-deoxy-2-(F-18) fluoro-D-glucose (FDG); sequential contrast-enhanced CT with PET imaging was performed from the base of skull to the iliac crest. Helical CT was performed with 5 mm collimation followed immediately by PET at multiple overlapping bed positions (5 minutes per bed position). Registered contrast-CT and attenuation corrected FDG PET and attenuation uncorrected FDG PET projection images were reviewed for interpretation.
The diagnostic PET/CT images showed 7 cm by 7 cm by 10 cm mass with mixed attenuation was noted in the left neck with extension into and invasion of the thyroid cartilage. An enlarged 2.5 cm level II lymph node was also present. Several ipsilateral sub-centimeter and borderline enlarged level III and IV lymph nodes were also detected. Both the mass and associated lymph nodes had markedly increased FDG uptake; in addition, the mass demonstrated central photopenia compatible with necrosis (maximum SUV of the neck mass of 17.0) (Figure 1A, Figure 1B, Figure 1C, Figure 1D). Thoracic imaging revealed intensely increased FDG uptake in the right atrium which correlated with an atrial soft tissue mass (maximum SUV of 10.2) (Figure 1C, Figure 1D, Figure 1E). A right upper lobe lung nodule with increased FDG uptake (maximum SUV of 4.0) was also observed (Figure 1C, Figure 1D). In addition, there was a filling defect within the left lower lobe pulmonary artery suspicious for a pulmonary embolism (maximum SUV of 2.3). A left lower lobe peripherally situated parenchymal abnormality with mildly increased FDG activity (maximum SUV of 2.1) was also noted (Figure 2A, Figure 2B, Figure 2C).
In view of the PET/CT findings in the chest, the patient underwent a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). The CTPA protocol included indirect CT venography of the pelvic and lower extremity veins using 1.25 mm collimation. The imaging was performed following intravenous injection of 100 ml of contrast material. Findings confirmed lingula and left lower pulmonary artery emboli, and a left lower lobe wedge shaped parenchymal abnormality compatible with an infarct. No thrombus was noted in the pelvis or lower limb veins. A right atrial soft tissue mass was also noted, as were two right upper lobe pulmonary nodules, suspicious for metastases.
A subsequent FNA of the neck mass confirmed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The final diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx with a T4, N2b, M1 FDG PET/radiological staging.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4895073/,1,images/PMC4/PMC489/PMC4895073_01
PMC5312201_01,PMC5312201,Male,27.0,"A 27-year-old male presented with a history of a single, widespread, brownish, flat lesion on the right upper chest. He had had the lesion for 15-16 years and it had remained unchanged throughout. The patient was not overtly concerned about the lesion. In addition, he complained of a well-defined, dark-coloured, elevated skin lesion over the brownish flat lesion. This dark-coloured, elevated lesion had emerged 3 months previously, increasing suddenly in size. During this period, the lesion's surface frequently exhibited erosions that bled spontaneously and then healed within a few days, only to recur again. There was no history of trauma, excessive sun exposure or previous inflammation in this area. The patient had been in his usual state of good health and his family history was inconsistent.
On physical examination, there was a brownish to hyperpigmented patch of 12x10 cm in size, with irregular, well-defined margins located on the right upper chest extending from the right mid-clavicular line to the right mid-axillary line. It was associated with hypertrichosis, without any signs of photo-damage. Over the lateral aspect of this large, brownish, macular lesion, there was a hyperpigmented plaque, 3-4cm in size, with a small crust in the centre of the lesion (Figure 1). Induration and tenderness manifested upon palpation. It also bled when touched and was not associated with any lymphadenopathy. Further examination and routine investigations revealed no associated cutaneous or systemic anomalies. However, dermoscopy could not be performed as no dermoscopes were available at the institution.
The entire hyperpigmented plaque was surgically removed with a small area of surrounding, brownish, macular lesion and sent for histopathology. The following differentials were kept: melanoma and BCC for the former lesion; Becker's nevus and cafe-au-lait macule for the latter. On histopathology, the brownish-coloured patch exhibited mild acanthosis of the epidermis and hypermelanosis of the basal layer, compatible with Becker's nevus. Moreover, the hyperpigmented plaque showed an aggregation of basaloid cells in a palisading arrangement in the superficial dermis, including melanin pigment both within and outside the tumour mass, which is characteristic of pigmented BCC (Figures 2 and 3). Thus, the final diagnosis was Becker's nevus with isolated pigmented BCC.
In addition to hypertrichosis and comedones, Becker's nevus may also be accompanied by various cutaneous and extra-cutaneous manifestations. Extra-cutaneous abnormalities associated with Becker's nevi are rare but include: breast hypoplasia, supernumerary nipples, aplasia of the pectoralis major muscle, ipsilateral limb shortening, segmental odontomaxillary dysplasia and lipoatrophy. Cutaneous involvement includes tinea versicolor, eczema, granuloma annulare, lymphangioma, generalized lichen planus and hypohidrosis.
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common non-melanoma skin cancer. The prevalence of this tumour increases within a population as exposure to sunlight increases. Thus, it is typically located in areas of chronic photo-damage, which undergo increased exposure to ultraviolet rays. However, in our patient, there was no sign of photo-damage and BCC occurred on the chest together with Becker's nevus, not a typical location for the malignancy. This was the most peculiar aspect of the case.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5312201/,3,images/PMC5/PMC531/PMC5312201_01

After he was transferred to our hospital, a baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which revealed multifocal cystic lesions confined to the uncinate process, body, and tail of pancreas associated with no high-risk stigmata neither a worrisome feature (Fig. 2). A multifocal Branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) was considered as a main differential diagnosis. Then, a routine follow-up has been provided to put the lesions under surveillance. Two years after the diagnosis he had an Endoscopic ultrasound sonography (EUS) which showed a 2.2 cm cystic lesion in the body-tail of pancreas associated with septation and Intramural nodules with no clear communication with the main pancreatic duct (PD) (Fig. 3). PD size is normal in body and tail. During same a sample was obtained for cytology. It yielded a positive result for cellular atypia and mucin. He had no familial history, past medical history. Physical examination was unremarkable. The laboratory data was almost normal including pancreatic tumor markers.
BD-IPMN suspicious for malignant transformation was considered as a provisional diagnosed. According to pancreatic cystic lesions guidelines. Surgical resection might be recommended because of his age, the cytology result and the presence of intramural nodules. Therefore, we decided to propose surgical resection and written informed consent was obtained. We decided that it is reasonable to perform a segmental resection to remove the IPMNs with the highest oncological risk at body-tail of pancreas and perform surveillance of the remaining lesions at the uncinate process.
Intraoperatively, we found multifocal cystic lesions at the tail-body of pancreas without invasion to the adjacent tissues. Due to the possibility of transformed IPMN, we performed a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and a systemic lymph node dissection. The postoperative course was uneventful.
In pathological examinations, sectioning of the pancreas revealed multicystic lesions. The Cysts are filled with small white rounded firm egg-like material, the largest cyst measures 3.0 x 3.0 x 1.4 cm. The spleen was unremarkable (Fig. 4).
Histologically, the hematoxylin and eosin sections showed lobules of pancreatic parenchyma with multiloculated variably sized thin-walled cysts, some contain dense inspissated eosinophilic laminated concretions. They are lined by a single layer of cuboidal acinar epithelium with apical eosinophilic zymogen granules with uniform basally located nuclei (Fig. 5). By Immunohistochemistry, the acinar cells showed strong cytoplasmic and membranous reactivity for CK8/18, trypsin, and chymotrypsin which confirmed the acinar cell differentiation (Figs. 6 and 7).
The final diagnosis was pancreatic acinar cystadenoma. Nine months have passed after resection, and no tumor recurrence and symptoms were observed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7390793/,1,images/PMC7/PMC739/PMC7390793_01

One scalp lesion and another one from the perineum were biopsied and both revealed a dense cellular infiltrate made up of mononuclear cells with conspicuous eosinophilic cytoplasm and large cleaved vesicular nucleus, some of them with shapes resembling the form of a kidney or of a coffee bean. The infiltrate was disposed in the superficial and middle dermis, assumed a band-like array and formed a sheet of cells in some areas. In other foci, in which neoplastic cells were sparser, numerous intermingling eosinophils were present (Figure 3). The surface of the perineal lesion was ulcerated, while in the lesion of the scalp some neoplastic cells were present between the keratocytes of an otherwise preserved epidermis. The diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) was made based on morphologic criteria and confirmed by positivity of abnormal Langerhans cells by anti-CD1a and anti-S100 immunostains and negativity for anti-CD68.
The patient was admitted to the adolescent ward for additional investigation. He had mild anemia, normal basic biochemistry tests, negative serologic tests for syphilis and negative mycological tests of the lesions (direct exam and culture). Total skeleton radiograph and scintigraphy failed to show any bone lesion. Thorax radiography, abdominal ultrasonography and computerized tomography of the abdomen were normal. The setting of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was defined by blood dosage of LH (0.10 mUI/ml, normal range of 0.8 - 7,6), FSH (0.53 mUI/ml, normal range of 0.7-11.1), total testosterone (27.0 ng/dL, normal range: 241-827) and free testosterone (0.50 pg/dL, normal range of 120-550) and hyperprolactenemia by the high blood level of prolactin (32.6 ng/ml, normal range of 4.6-21.4). Diabetes insipidus was confirmed by water restriction test, in which the patient was unable to concentrate the urine, in spite of an increase of concentration of blood sodium from 139-149 mEq/L and development of arterial hypotension. All these parameters were reversed after administration of anti-diuretic hormone analog, which the patient continues to take. An insulin-induced hypoglycemia provocative test demonstrated GH deficiency, but cortisol secretion was preserved. Blood TSH and free T4 were within the normal range. Magnetic resonance imaging of the sella turcica showed thickening of the pituitary stalk and size reduction of the pituitary, suggesting infiltration of the neurohypophysis by the abnormal Langerhans cells. There was no indication at the MRI of other pathologic process that could explain the endocrinologic disturbances. The final diagnosis was of LCH with involvement of the skin, the pituitary stalk (diabetes insipidus and hyperprolactenemia), and the anterior pituitary (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and GH deficiency). The patient was treated with a chemotherapy regimen consisting of an induction phase with prednisone 40 mg/m2/day every day for four weeks with withdrawal for two additional weeks and vinblastin 6mg/m2 IV bolus once a week in the first six weeks. The consolidation phase lasted six months with five days of prednisone 40 mg/m2/day and one application of vinblastin 6 mg/m2 IV bolus every three weeks. The patient experienced complete remission (Figure 13), and after the end of chemotherapy his puberty was induced by hormonal replacement therapy. Some months later, there was recurrence of lesions in the scalp confirmed on histopathologic grounds, which were successfully treated with topical corticosteroid and nitrogen mustard. The patient is currently in good health with a follow up of six years.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3997242/,12,images/PMC3/PMC399/PMC3997242_01
PMC6297057_01,PMC6297057,Female,43.0,"A 43 year-old female was admitted to our hospital with a chief complaint of right upper pain and palpable mass. On physical examination, there was slight tenderness and semimobile mass in the right upper abdomen. Clinical examination did not demonstrate any persistent weak abdominal pain and mass. Her past medical and surgical history was unremarkable. Moreover, Family history and psychosocial history were also not particular.
In abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), 130 x 100 x 90 mm huge cystic mass was demonstrated in right upper peritoneal cavity. The cyst had thickened wall and many enhanced nodules. Many nodules and the thickened wall were slightly enhanced in early phase (Fig. 1A) and gradually enhanced in delayed phase (Fig. 1B). Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that intra-cystic fluid was bleeding or mucinous fluid as the intensity was slightly high in T1WI (Fig. 1C), high in T2WI (Fig. 1D), and slightly high in fat suppression T1WI. The thickened wall of the cyst and mural nodules were high intensity in Diffusion-weighted MRI. The findings of connection with pancreatic head suggested a tumor originated from pancreas. The differential diagnoses were MCN, mucinous cystic adenocarcinoma and hemorrhagic cyst. After an extensive discussion in our institute, we planned pancreaticoduodenectomy for this abdominal tumor.
She was taken to the operating room by a surgical oncologist who primarily specialized in pancreatic resections and had been in practice for over 10 years. In surgical findings, this tumor did not attach to gastrointestinal tract and originated from pancreatic head (Fig. 2A). The aspirated fluid was bloody and the cyst had re-increased for short time in operation. In these reasons, we diagnosed the tumor as hemorrhagic cyst and selected partial pancreatectomy because this tumor was resected completely (Fig. 2B). The cystic wall was thickened and elastic soft. No tumoral change found in the surface of cystic wall (Fig. 2C). Post-operative course was good and she was discharged on post-operative day 9. CEA and CA19-9 in intra-cystic fluid were 115,060 ng/ml and 113,373 U/ml.
Final pathology demonstrated that the cystic mass had well-formed cyst wall with an inner mucosal lining, submucosal layer, and muscularis propria as gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 3A-C). As the non-tumoral epithelium in small area was similar to crypt epithelium of the stomach and immunohistochemistry of the non-tumoral mucosa was positive for CK7 (Fig. 3D), negative for CK20 (Fig. 3E), and negative for CDX-2 (Fig. 3F), the pathological finding of non-tumoral tissue was the enteric duplication cyst of gastric type. Adenocarcinoma with moderate to well differentiation invaded to subserosal layer over smooth muscle layer in broad area of the cystic wall (Fig. 4A-C). The invasive cancer cells invaded lymphatic system, venous system, and nervous system. Several lymph nodes resected together besides tumor had no metastasis. The immunohistochemistry of the tumoral mucosa was 50% positive for CK7 (Fig. 4D), positive for CK20 (Fig. 4E), and positive for CDX-2 (Fig. 4F). The final diagnosis was completely isolated advanced enteric duplication cyst cancer because this cyst was not attached to a wall of gastrointestinal tract and adjacent to pancreatic head. Therefore, this cyst was not originated from pancreas head.
During hospital stay in post-operative period, she was counseled that we identified an isolated enteric duplication cyst with advanced cancer. We recommend treatment by S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy according to the adaptation for criteria of advanced gastric cancer. She had taken S-1 for 1 year without rest of medication and lived for 1.5 year after surgery without any evidence of malignancy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6297057/,16,images/PMC6/PMC629/PMC6297057_01
PMC9149216_01,PMC9149216,Male,4.0,"A 4-year-old male toddler presented to our hospital due to the elevated serum HCG levels, produced by the tumor. On examination, the muscle strength of the lower limbs was grade 4 and the skin of the whole body was hairy, with a beard and pubic hair. The development of external genitalia was significantly larger than the boys of the same age. An irregular cafe-au-lait macule could be seen on the right forehead, which might be considered as a sign of the syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed a space-occupying lesion in the right lateral ventricle with hydrocephalus ( Figures 1A - C ). Increasing levels of beta-hCG (207.72 U/L:NV 0-5) were found in serum. The patient had epiphyseal dysplasia of the lower limbs with a slight limp in the right lower limb. The patient underwent space-occupying resection of the lesions and external ventricular drain ( Figures 1D - F ). Microscopical analysis indicated that the tumor was a malignant tumor of germ cell origin without any nongerminomas germ cell tumors components ( Figure 1J ). Immunochemistry was performed and showed AFP/HCG negative and PLAP/CD117 positive by postoperative tissue, and probably the HCG-producing trophoblastic giant cells have been missed. The Ki67 proliferation index of hot spots was high (50%-60%). After surgery, acne improved and beta-hCG returned to normal levels. Combined with histological morphology and immunohistochemistry, the final diagnosis was a secreting CNS germinoma.
The white blood cell and tumor tissue specimens of the patient were collected for NGS detection based on a panel including 539 cancer-related genes (Simceredx). By comprehensive genomic profiling, somatic KIT p.Y823D (AF 46.29%) and SDHA p. T396Nfs*14 (AF 48.35%) was detected but no second hits or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumor tissue ( Figures 2A, B ). Copy number variations (CNV) including the gain of chromosome 7 and 21, and loss of chromosome 13 were identified ( Figure 2C ). Due to the younger age of diagnosis with a cafe-au-lait macule phenotype, we confirmed the germline mutation in leukocytes. No cafe-au-lait macule-associated tumor syndrome mutation was identified, but SDHA p. T396Nfs*14 was confirmed a heterozygous germline mutation. Further analysis by Sanger sequencing identified that the SDHA heterozygous mutation originated from his father with a normal phenotype ( Figures 2D, E ). The patient didn't have familial cancer history.
The patient received chemotherapy (temozolomide + nedaplatin + etoposide) and radiation therapy after surgery. Computed tomography scan after chemotherapy in of the brain showed a few effusions in the right subdural. Up to the article submission, there was no tumor recurrence ( Figures 1G - I ).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9149216/,10,images/PMC9/PMC914/PMC9149216_01
PMC5985260_01,PMC5985260,Female,63.0,"A 63-year-old Hispanic female was brought to the emergency department by family with a two day history of right upper quadrant pain. Associated symptoms were nausea, vomiting, fevers and chills. Her past medical history included hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Her surgical history was significant for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed in an outside facility 9 years prior. The patient denied any family or personal history of malignancy or genetic disorders. Her family history only included diabetes in her deceased father, in whom she stated cause of death was unknown. Patient's home medications included Omeprazole 20 mg daily, Amlodipine 5 mg daily and Sitagliptin/Metformin 50/500 mg tab twice a day. She denied any history of tobacco, alcohol and recreational drug use. She was divorced and living with her adult daughter and family. The patient was normotensive, tachycardic and had a 39  C temperature. Physical examination demonstrated tenderness in the right upper quadrant and mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant and supra-pubic area. White blood cell count was 26 on arrival (normal 3-11). Liver function tests, CEA, CA 19-9, and AFP were within normal ranges. Blood and urine cultures were obtained and the patient was sent for a computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis. CT scan with intravenous (IV) contrast revealed a complex mass with solid and cystic components involving the posterior aspect of the right lobe of the liver, measuring 4.6 cm in greatest diameter (Fig. 1). A complex mass containing internal air-fluid levels centrally in the lower abdomen was also noted (Fig. 2). A repeat CT scan with oral contrast was obtained to evaluate involvement of the gastrointestinal tract and demonstrated thickened small bowel loops, which were contiguous with a poly-lobulated mass; the central component of this mass contained oral contrast (Fig. 3). After an extensive discussion with the patient, surgical exploration was planned.
Surgery was performed by a seasoned general surgeon, with the assistance of a second year general surgery resident. At surgery, a large pelvic mass was found and it was inseparable from two segments of ileum. Small bowel mesentery and the medial aspect of the sigmoid colon and mesocolon were adherent. Enteric spillage in the intra-abdominal cavity was not noted but there was significant inflammation in the surrounding tissue. No other suspicious lesions were identified in the abdomen. A small portion of the mesenteric mass was sent for frozen section, which revealed a spindle cell morphology. A resection of tumor with 20 cm of small bowel, 30 cm away from the ileocecal junction, was performed. The inseparable portion of the sigmoid colon was resected en block. A stapled small bowel anastomosis was then performed in a side-to-side, functional end-to-end fashion. An end colostomy was fashioned using the descending colon, in light of surrounding inflammation and an un-prepped colon. The liver lesion was not amenable to surgical biopsy due to location and inability to palpate intra-operatively. Blood cultures obtained at admission grew Streptococcus anginosus. Interventional radiology was consulted to perform an image-guided biopsy of the liver lesion, which occurred on post-operative day two. CT-guided core needle biopsies were obtained with an 18-gauge biopsy gun and 100 mL of purulent fluid was drained from the liver lesion. The radiologist inserted an 8 French pigtail catheter into the abscess cavity.
The final pathology revealed a gastrointestinal stromal tumor originating from the ileum, 9 cm in largest dimension. The tumor was communicating with the intestinal lumen via a mucosal defect, with enteric content noted through the central part of the mass. The mass was adhered to the sigmoid colon, with no violation of colonic serosa. Mitotic count was less than 5/50 high-power fields, and there was no necrosis present. The margins were free of microscopic disease and the mesenteric lymph nodes were negative for malignancy. Subsequent staining revealed CD117 (c-KIT) positive and CD34, alpha-smooth muscle actin and S-100-negative tissue. The final diagnosis was intermediate-risk GIST. The pathology from the liver lesion was reported as hepatic parenchyma with extensive necrosis and inflammatory cells, suggestive of abscess. Fluid cultures from the liver were positive for Streptococcus anginosus.
The patient had an unremarkable post-operative course. Three days after insertion of the drainage catheter into the liver abscess and after minimal drainage for >48 h, a follow up CT scan of the abdomen was performed. A significantly smaller hypo-attenuating lesion in the liver was noted and the catheter was removed under CT guidance. On post-operative day six, with appropriate bowel function, tolerance of a regular diet, resolution of fevers for over 72 h and normalization of the white blood cell count, she was discharged home. The patient received Ceftriaxone 2 g daily IV and Metronidazole 500 mg every eight hours orally while she remained inpatient. She was discharged on Ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily for four additional weeks. Post-operative instructions included a referral to a medical oncologist to initiate a surveillance schedule and determine necessity of adjuvant therapy, as well as a follow up surgical evaluation in ten days. The patient was started on Imatinib mesylate, 400 mg daily. She was compliant with post-operative instructions and tolerated adjuvant Imatinib with no adverse reactions or side effects. We performed a colostomy reversal 4 months after the initial operation. Pre-operative CT scan did not reveal recurrent disease and the liver abscess had resolved. The submitted specimens were microscopically free of disease and there were no suspicious lesions in the abdominal cavity. Surveillance CT scan at 12 months showed no tumor recurrence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5985260/,3,images/PMC5/PMC598/PMC5985260_01

Physical examination found a patient cachectic with a mass of right chest wall pain on palpation. The chest radiography demonstrated bilateral mass lesion (Figure 1) and thoracal CT showed mass lesion in left lung with parietal invasion (Figure 2) and in right lower lobe (Figure 3). Complete blood count showed anemia (Hb:9.7mg/dl). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 94 mm/hr. Bronchoscopic examination revealed a large polypoidal tumor arising from the left lower lobe bronchus, histology at bronchial biopsy revealed a malignant melanoma :the cytoplasm of the tumor cells contained granular, brown pigment compatible with melanin, the tumor extended to the bronchial epithelium. Immunohistochemical stains were strongly positive for antibodies to S-100 protein and humain melanoma black-45 which confirmed the diagnosis. Surgical biopsy of the left parietal mass was confirmed by invasive malignant melanoma.
To exclude the possibility of metastasis from occult primary malignant melanoma, an extensive examination was carried out, the patient had no past history of skin tumor, and we could not find any skin, external ear, or ocular lesions. Gastrointestinal endoscopy, colonoscopy, and endoscopy of the nasal cavity were performed, and no possible primary tumor was detected. The final diagnosis was primary melanoma of the lung, the patient was given chemotherapy consisting of the docarbazinze, nimustine hydrochloride and vincristine, the patient died of tumor progression one month after first cycle of chemotherapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361206/,3,images/PMC3/PMC336/PMC3361206_01
PMC5771368_02,PMC5771368,Female,20.0,"The first electromyography (EMG) (2005) showed a myopathic pattern in the lower limbs from which a muscle biopsy was requested but the patient postponed it. Until the patient was 20 years old, her symptoms were progressive; then, she experienced a stabilization of the disease. A biopsy taken in 2011 revealed dystrophic changes (degeneration/ regeneration) with markedly increased endomysial connective tissue; no inflammatory cell infiltration, ragged red fiber, cytoplasmic body and lipid or glycogen accumulation in muscle fibers were seen (fig.1). An immunohistochemistry (IHC) study of sarcolemmal proteins showed sarcolemma labeling of all fibers with DYS1, DYS2, DYS3, alpha and gamma sarcoglycan, dysferlin, merosin, and beta-spectrin (fig.2). 
The second EMG in 2011 showed a myopathic process pronounced in the proximal muscles. With a diagnosis of LGMD, rehabilitation, physical therapy, and stretching exercises were advised to improve her mobility and prevent disused atrophy or contracture deformities. In April 2015, she complained of acute left visual loss for four days with painful eye movements that lasted for several days. Her muscle strength had not changed for 5 years. On examination of her pupils, the left one had 2+ relative afferent pupillary defects (RAPD). Left visual acuity was finger counting from one meter with cecocentral scotoma in the visual field. Extraocular muscles and other cranial nerves were intact. Ophthalmologic consultation revealed no bulbar ophthalmic problems. For further evaluation, we planned a brain and optic pathway MRI that excluded compressive lesions of the optic pathway and disclosed multiple periventricular, centrum semiovale, corpus callosum, juxta cortical, and infra tentorial (brain stem and cerebellum) T2 hypersignal demyelinating plaques with multiple lesion enhancement (fig 3) that fulfilled the McDonald criteria for MS.
From this, we prescribed intravenous methyl prednisolone (5 gr divided in 5 days) for the treatment of her optic neuritis. She responded significantly and her visual acuity ameliorated so that she could read from 30 cm. Vasculitis tests and anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies were negative. The final diagnosis was relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).

Physical exam revealed a toxic-appearing female in respiratory distress. Vital signs were temperature 100.5 F; blood pressure 103/76mmHg; heart rate 126bpm; respiratory rate 32bpm; and 99% oxygen saturation on room air. She had decreased breath sounds on the right side, and exhibited right upper quadrant tenderness on palpation. The cardiovascular exam was remarkable only for the tachycardia.
A portable chest radiograph (CXR) revealed complete atelectasis of the right lung with adjacent large right pleural effusion, causing mediastinal shift to the left, consistent with tension hydrothorax (Figure 1). A computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest confirmed the above findings; there was no evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection (Figure 2). An ultrasound-guided thoracentesis removed 1.5L of serosanguinous fluid. The patient reported relief of chest pain and dyspnea after the thoracentesis.
The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated for presumed pneumonia and sepsis with broad spectrum antibiotics. A purified protein derivative for tuberculosis was negative. She had a chest tube placed on hospital day 2 for recurrent right pleural effusion, with return of two liters of serosanguinous fluid. Pleural fluid cultures, acid fast bacteria (AFB) and cytology were all negative.
Because of worsening abdominal pain and distention, on hospital day 4 a CT of the abdomen/pelvis was ordered and revealed a pelvic mass of unclear uterine or adnexal etiology, with abdominal implants and ascites, suspicious for malignancy. A follow-up pelvic ultrasound was less suggestive of malignancy, and revealed two solid uterine lesions and an enlarged right ovary with cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral complex cystic adnexal structures with hemorrhage; a tubo-ovarian abscess was suspected.
On hospital day 14, the patient underwent laparoscopy with biopsy. Laparoscopy revealed blue-tinged lesions on the central omentum, a nodular omental lesion, and pelvic wall nodule. The peritoneum was described as having a fibrinous exudate with mucinous appearance along the surface. Biopsies of the omental and pelvic nodules confirmed the lesions to be consistent with endometriosis and a pelvic wall abscess. The final diagnosis was disseminated endometriosis resulting in tension hydrothorax and pelvic inflammatory disease.

PMC8291962_01,PMC8291962,Male,75.0,"A 75-year-old male patient was admitted to Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital on 23 November 2018 after two-week-history of post-exercise dyspnea and chest pain. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sound, increased tactile fremitus on the affected side, and dullness to percussion of the left lung. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse thickening and calcification of the pleura on both sides, pleural effusion and atelectasis on the left side (Figure 1A and B). After hospitalization, the patient received a thoracentesis on November 26, 2018. The pleural fluid was bloody exudate, and no tumor cells were found in the exfoliated cells of the pleural fluid sample. According to the imaging findings, we tracked the patient's occupational history and learned that the patient had a history of close contact with asbestos for 30 years. The diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma needs to be ruled out clinically, and it is planned to be transferred to surgery for open pleural biopsy. At the same time, laboratory examination revealed elevated plasma D-dimer (26190Ug/L), combined with the patient's chest pain, dyspnea symptoms, and a large amount of pleural effusion, the possibility of pulmonary embolism should be considered. Then, the computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed for the patient, and the results showed that there was embolism in the right pulmonary artery branch (Figure 2). After the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, we immediately used anticoagulant drugs for the patient. Because anticoagulants are easy to cause massive hemorrhage, no open pleural biopsy was performed. After anticoagulation therapy, the patient's symptoms of pleural effusion and dyspnea were improved and the patient discharged on December 18, 2018.
However, after being discharged from the hospital, the patient was still admitted to the hospital several times due to chest pain and dyspnea, and the reexamined chest CT still showed a large amount of pleural effusion on the left side (Figure 3A and B). When he was hospitalized again on July 8, 2019, there was no obvious abnormality in plasma D-dimer and CTPA, which ruled out the possibility of recurrent pulmonary embolism. We also considered the possibility of pneumonia and tuberculous pleurisy, but repeated pleural effusion and sputum culture did not show any positive results and there was no evidence for tuberculosis. Because of the long-term bloody pleural effusion, the possibility of lung cancer is also considered. The patient's pleural fluid was sent for pathological examination for many times, but no tumor cells were found. PET-CT examination showed diffuse thickening of the bilateral pleura with calcification, mainly on the left side. FDG metabolism was increased, and malignant tumors were considered (Figure 4). We consider that this patient may have malignant mesothelioma. Later, the patient underwent an ultrasound-guided pleural biopsy, and the pathological examination revealed fibroblast-like spindle cells arranged in bundles or chaotic shapes (Figure 5A and B). The results of immunohistochemistry were: CK(Pan)(+), WT1(+), GATA3(+), P63(-), TTF-1(-), EMA(-), CD117(-), DOG1(-), Calretinin(-), CK5/6(-), CD34(-), ERG(-), SMA(-), Desmin(-), S100(-), MiTF(-), HMB45(Melanoma)(-), MyoD1(-), Caldesmon(-), D2-40(-), CEA(-), Vimentin(-) (Figure 6). Combined with the above examination results, the final diagnosis was sarcomatoid pleural mesothelioma. However, two days later, the patient suddenly developed a coma, facial cyanosis, and sudden cardiac arrest. And the blood pressure, oxygen saturation cannot be measured at that time. We consider that the cause of cardiac arrest may be an acute myocardial infarction or acute pulmonary embolism. After tracheal intubation, electric defibrillation and chest compression, the patient discharged voluntarily.

She had a history of hypertension, spinal canal stenosis, and inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome. She had no abdominal symptoms; however, survey for malignancy helped detect the tumor incidentally. Laboratory data revealed a low white blood cell count of 2440/muL (normal range [NR]: 3300-8600) and low sodium level (133 mEq/dL, NR: 138-145). The following tumor markers were all within the respective NRs: carcinoembryonic antigen (4.1 ng/mL, NR:  5.8); carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (12 U/mL, NR:  37); duke pancreatic antigen type 2 (<25 U/mL, NR:  150); and s-pancreas antigen-1 (8.5 U/mL, NR:  30). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed calcification at the edge of the tumor (Fig. 1B, C), no cystic lesion, and gradual enhancement. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed hypointensity of the tumor on T1-weighted images (Fig. 1D) and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (Fig. 1E). EUS revealed the tumor had a clear boundary with a low echoic mass. We suspected that it was a neuroendocrine tumor, acinar cell carcinoma, solitary-pseudopapillary neoplasm, schwannoma, or anaplastic ductal carcinoma based on the calcification, gradual enhancement, and expansive growth. Therefore, EUS-FNA was performed (Fig. 2A), and spindle-shaped cells (Fig. 2B, C) that were immunopositive for S-100 (Fig. 2D) and negative for c-kit, CD34, and desmin were detected.

No other abnormality was found on physical examination and we suspected that he suffered with deep vein thrombosis. Ultrasonography showed a cystic mass containing hypoechoic materials attached to the left common femoral vein (Fig. 1A). For further evaluation, we performed CT venography using 64 channel multi-detector computed tomography (Aquilion, Toshiba, Japan) with the patient in the supine position. A 22-gauge intravenous cannula was placed in the dorsal vein of the left foot, and a tourniquet was placed around the left knee. Forty milliliters of a contrast medium diluted with 60 milliliters of saline was automatically injected via a Y adapter into the left leg at a rate of 3 cc/sec. The optimal scan delay for the venous phase was determined by use of bolus tracking at the left popliteal vein. The axial and coronal reconstruction images showed a 1.7 cm sized cystic mass compressing the left common femoral vein along with dilated medial circumflex femoral and obturator veins that provided collateral circulation for the occluded left common femoral vein (Fig. 1B, C). A 3D volume rendering image showed an abrupt tapered disconnection of the left common femoral vein along with the formation of multiple collateral vessels (Fig. 1D). The patient underwent an operation because of his swollen leg. Surgical exploration showed an approximately 1.5 cm sized cystic mass over the anterior surface of the left common femoral vein. A longitudinal venostomy was performed at this location and a gelatinous material exuded from the mass and this gelatinous material could also be aspirated from the mass. A 10-cm long segment of the left common femoral vein/distal iliac vein was resected and a Gore-Tex graft was interposed. Microscopically, a cystic widened adventitial layer of the vein showed adventitial hemorrhage, fibrin deposition and focal aggregation of foamy histiocytes and focal myxoid degeneration (Fig. 1E, F). CT venography was performed again after the operation for a follow up evaluation. The cystic mass in the left inguinal areas was gone, as were the multiple collateral vessels (Fig. 1G).

Her relevant biochemical examination was normal and reported as follows: Hemoglobin 131 g/L (n 120-160); beta-hCG <5 (n < 5); cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) 31 kU/L (n < 35); alpha-fetoprotein 2 ug/L (n < 9); carcinoembryonic antigen 2.1 ug/L (n < 5); and lactate dehydrogenase 4 U/L (n 100-225).
Initial ultrasound imaging identified a complex solid and cystic 5 cm left adnexal mass with the solid component representing the dominant portion of the lesion [Figure 1]. The cysts were thinly septated and adjacent to the solid component. The solid component was hypoechoic with posterior shadowing demonstrating small echogenic foci suggestive of internal calcifications. The right adnexa and uterus were unremarkable.
A subsequent computed tomography confirmed the findings of an enhancing solid and cystic mass in the left adnexa [Figure 2]. The cystic component was again shown to be thinly septated. The solid component demonstrated enhancement with small punctate and amorphous calcifications. Following this, an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed [Figure 3]. This demonstrated subtle T1 hyperintensity within the septated fluid component best appreciated on fat saturation images and consistent with hemorrhage or proteinaceous/mucinous content. The solid component was T1 and markedly T2 hypointense (isointense to skeletal muscle) and homogenously enhancing, consistent with fibrous stromal tissue. No central necrosis was present.
The patient was referred to gynecology, where she underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy with complete excision of the left adnexal lesion. Gross pathology confirmed a 7 x 5 x 4 cm mass with a solid tan-yellow component comprising 75% of the mass and a mucin containing cystic component representing the other 25% of the lesion. No hemorrhage or necrosis was identified. Corresponding histopathology confirmed the solid component consisted of transitional-type epithelium within a fibrous stroma characteristic of Brenner tumor and the cystic tumor showed a single row of uniform mucin-rich columnar cells with basal nuclei lining glands and cysts characteristic for mucinous cystadenoma [Figure 4]. The final diagnosis was benign mixed Brenner tumor and mucinous cystadenoma.
The patient had recovered completely by the 2-month clinical follow-up and has not received subsequent post-operative imaging. On clinical examination, the patient was noted to have a cervical polyp which was resected with a separate operation and the patient has had no ongoing abnormal bleeding. An endometrial biopsy was negative for malignancy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193213/,13,images/PMC7/PMC719/PMC7193213_01

He had a history of cervical disc herniation, lumbar compression fracture and abdominal aortic aneurysm. Physical examination revealed slight tenderness in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, and no masses were palpable. Laboratory data on admission showed: erythrocyte count 411 x 104/mm3 (normal 410-530), hemoglobin 13.7 g/dl (normal 14-18), leukocyte count 9,800/mm3 (normal 4,000-8,000), platelet count 27.1 x 104/mm3 (normal 15-40), serum total protein 6.8 g/dl (normal 6.5-8.0), total bilirubin 0.67 mg/dl (normal 0.2-1.0), aspartate aminotransferase 16 IU/l (normal 10-40), alanine aminotransferase 12 IU/l (normal 5-40), alkaline phosphatase 339 IU/l (normal 115-360), lactate dehydrogenase 256 IU/l (normal 119-229), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase 56 IU/l (normal 10-47), serum amylase 100 U/l (normal 33-116), blood urea nitrogen 14.0 mg/dl (normal 8-22), creatinine 0.8 mg/dl (normal 0.6-1.1), and C-reactive protein 1.71 mg/dl (normal 0-0.3). The serum level of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was slightly elevated to 6.5 ng/ml (normal 0-5), and the carbohydrate antigen (CA19-9) level was elevated to 159.3 U/ml (normal 0-37).
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed numerous strongly enhanced abnormal vessels and a hypovascular lesion in the area of the pancreatic tail (fig. 1a). Angiographic study of the celiac artery confirmed racemose vascular networks in the tail of the pancreas and early venous return to the portal system (fig. 1b). Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) revealed narrowing and displacement of the main pancreatic duct in the tail of the pancreas (fig. 1c). Screening esophagoscopy showed a 0-IIa+IIc type tumor in the lower thoracic esophagus and multiple Lugol-voiding lesions. Histological examination of esophagoscopic biopsies showed squamous cell carcinoma.
Based on these findings, P-AVM and chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer with esophageal cancer were diagnosed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy and distal pancreatectomy with partial transverse colectomy were performed. The operative time was 402 min, and the amount of blood loss was 956 ml. There was a honeycomb-like structure with collected vessels in the pancreas. The splenic vein was occupied by thrombi (fig. 2).
Histological examination of the resected pancreas revealed rupture of the dilated pancreatic duct with bleeding (fig. 3a), pancreatic stones (fig. 3b) and severe atrophy with fibrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma (fig. 3c). These findings were consistent with chronic pancreatitis. In addition, many abnormal vessels, some containing thrombi, were observed in the pancreas (fig. 3d). The final diagnosis was P-AVM consequent to severe chronic pancreatitis and esophageal carcinoma. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and CA19-9 levels normalized to 27.6 U/ml.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3934809/,4,images/PMC3/PMC393/PMC3934809_01
PMC4531605_01,PMC4531605,Male,35.0,"A 35-year-old man with painless gross hematuria with left flank pain of two-month duration was admitted to our hospital on April 12, 2001. He gave no history of B symptoms and did not have a significant medical history. There was no enlargement of the liver, spleen or lymph nodes. Evaluation at that time included normal findings on chest X-ray films, serum chemistry, complete blood count and serum protein electrophoresis, except slightly elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and increased lactate dehydrogenase. To evaluate gross hematuria, intravenous pyelography (IVP) and cystoscopy were performed. IVP showed a lobulated filling defect on the left wall of the urinary bladder associated with left hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Cystoscopy revealed an edematous walnut sized and broad-based mass on the left ureteral orifice and bladder neck. Histological examination of the biopsy taken transurethrally from two parts of the bladder mucosa and urethra showed malignant lymphoma (Figure 1A). Immunohistochemical study showed positive reaction for the monoclonal antibody marking B-lymphocytes (Figure 1B). For stage evaluation, chest CT, abdomino-pelvic CT and bone marrow biopsy were performed. Chest CT scan showed no visible lymph node or mass. Abdomino-pelvic CT scan demonstrated left side hydronephrois and hydroureter with left proximal ureter infiltration and thickening of the left lateral wall of the bladder with perivesical fat infiltration without lymph node enlargement (Figure 2A, 2B). Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed normocellular marrow with diffuse infiltration of lymphoid cells (Figure 3). The beta2-microglobin level was 3.4 mg/L.
The final diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma arising from the urinary bladder and ureter with bone marrow involvement. The disease was stage IV according to the Ann Arbor classification and intermediate histologic grade according to the Working Formulation. International Prognostic Index (IPI) score was 3 (high-intermediate group).
We started systemic chemotherapy with the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and predinisone (CHOP) regimen (cyclophophamide 750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 and oral predinisone 100 mg/m2 on day 1 through 5). Eight cycles of CHOP were given every 3 weeks. The lesions of the bladder and left urinary tract were nearly completely regressed after two cycles of systemic CHOP chemotherapy with simultaneous restoration of urinary function (Figure 2C, 2D). After 18 months of follow-up, the patient is in complete remission (CR) status with normal bone marrow and no mass lesion is observed in the bladder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4531605/,7,images/PMC4/PMC453/PMC4531605_01
PMC4643465_01,PMC4643465,Male,66.0,"We present a 66-year-old male patient with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity. During the last months, he experienced an intentional weight loss of 18 kg. Due to the body mass loss, he noticed a mass of approximately 3 x 3 cm on the right pre-auricular region. A family practice physician explored the patient and ordered an ultrasound, which reported a necrotic lymph node. There was no other pertinent history. Physical examination demonstrated a 3 x 3.5 cm, firm, fixed, non-tender mass on the right pre-auricular region. Facial nerve function was preserved. No palpable lymphadenopathy was present on the neck region. A head and neck MRI showed an ovoid heterogeneous lesion, dependent of the right parotid gland of 27 x 28 mm, hypointense in T1 and isointense in T2 with well-defined borders and an area of hemorrhage in its interior (Fig. 1). It was reported as a probable pleomorphic adenoma with hemorrhagic transformation.
A superficial parotidectomy with identification and preservation of the facial nerve was performed (Fig. 2). The right parotid gland was extracted with a mass of approximately 4 x 4 cm (Fig. 3) and a No. 10 Blake drain was inserted. The final pathology report revealed a well-differentiated MASC. The neoplasm substituted the normal parotid parenchyma and had well-defined borders. The tumor had a multinodular rearrangement with nodules divided by fibrous septa. The nodules showed a microcystic pattern with papillary structures. The neoplastic cells were medium size, with predominant eosinophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 4). A dense multivacuolated eosinophilic secretion was identified inside de cysts. The cellular nucleus was medium size, with smooth borders and homogeneous chromatin. There was no significant number of mitoses or necrotic areas. The immunophenotype was positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CK8/18, vimentin, S-100 protein (Fig. 5), and mammoglobin. There was no expression of p63, CK5/6, DOG1 or zymogen granule formation. The surgical margins were negative for malignancy.
The final diagnosis was MASC staged as a pT2, cN0, cM0, stage II, R0 salivary carcinoma. The patient presented slight facial nerve dysfunction (grade II House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system), that recovered approximately one month after surgery. The Blake drain was removed on the twelfth day after the procedure. After discussing the case in our multidisciplinary tumor board, no further surgical intervention (total parotidectomy or selective neck dissection) or adjuvant therapy (radiation) was recommended. The patient will have a close follow up that would entail a complete history and physical examination every 3 months for the first 5 years. There is no evidence of persistent or recurrent disease 4 months post-surgery and the facial nerve function is back to baseline.
MASC was first described in 2010 by Skalova et al. in a clinicopathologic study of a series of 16 salivary gland tumors with histomorphologic and immunohistochemical features similar to SC of the breast. One of the principal similarities between MASC and SC of the breast is the presence of the translocation t(12;15) (p13;q25), that results in the formation of the oncogenic fusion gene ETV6-NTK3, which is also present in other tumors such as infantile fibrosarcoma, myelogenous leukemia, and congenital mesoblastic nephroma. The fusion of the transcriptional regulator gene ETV6 and the membrane receptor kinase-type NTRK3 results in a chimeric tyrosine kinase that activates cell proliferation and increases survival of the tumor cells playing a fundamental role on its oncogenesis. MASC and SC of the breast also share immunohistochemical features such as being positive for S100 protein, EMA, and vimentin, while being ""triple negative"" (ER/PR/Her2 negative).
The most important differential diagnosis for MASC is the ACC. ACC is characterized by the presence of large, serous, acinar cells with cytoplasmatic PAS positive zymogen-like granules that are absent in MASC. MASC is histologically characterized by the proliferation of uniform eosinophilic cells with a vacuolated cytoplasm, growing within a microcystic, macrocystic, and papillary architecture. Even though the similar growth rate between MASC and ACC, MASC is more likely to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes, it should be considered as a more aggressive tumor compared with the regular low grade ACC.
MASC has a slight preference for male patients while ACC mainly affects women. In Table 1, we state the gender preferences of MASC from nine case series published between 2010 and 2014. Immunophenotypic features that can be used to differentiate MASC from ACC are the expression of protein S100 and positive mammaglobin staining. S100 is strongly positive in MASC, while it is negative in ACC. Immunohistochemistry is also helpful in differentiating SDC from MASC because SDC normally expresses androgen receptors or HER-2/neu and not S100 protein. Vimentin, STAT5a and cytokeratin 7 are other important immunohistochemical markers present in MASC. MASC has also been misdiagnosed as cystadenocarcinoma because of the cystic component that is sometimes present.
MASC usually presents as a painless, non-tender mass that increases in size overtime. The majority of MASC arise from the parotid gland, accounting for two thirds of the reported cases. Table 2 presents the location, size, and lymph node involvement of MASC in eight case series. Bishop found that the mean age for presentation of MASC is 47 years (Table 2), in contrast with SC of the breast that usually occurs in younger patients. MASC is considered a low-grade carcinoma with a favorable prognosis; according to Skalova et al. it has moderate risk for local recurrence (15%), lymph node metastases (20%), and a low risk for distant metastases (5%). In Table 3 we present the clinical follow up of six case series. There have been reports of high-grade transformation in MASC in which it becomes a far more aggressive tumor with an accelerated clinical course that results in cancer dissemination and death.
The definite diagnosis of MASC is done by confirming the translocation t(12;15) (p13;q25), which results in the ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion. However, a negative test for ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion does not rule out the diagnosis of MASC, it can also be done with the presence of positive immunohistochemical studies for STAT5, mammoglobin, and S-100 protein. We revised the data from different case series regarding the presence of ETV6-NTK3 gene rearrangement and the immunohistochemical findings of MASC and stated it on Table 4.
The treatment of MASC is not well defined because most studies in the literature are retrospective in nature. The reported disease free period for MASC ranges from 71 to 115 months, shorter than the one reported in ACC, which is 92-148 months. Table 5 presents different treatment alternatives that have been used for MASC. The treatment of choice in high-grade transformation MASC should be radical surgery with neck dissection in addition to adjuvant radiotherapy. In the future, the inhibition of ETV6-NTRK3 may become a therapeutic target for patients with MASC as for other tumors that express this mutation (Table 5).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4643465/,5,images/PMC4/PMC464/PMC4643465_01

A diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was ruled out. Her clinical signs were initially attributed to severe gastritis and an ulcer in the pyloric canal. She had suffered from primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) since 1992 and had been treated with 750 mg of ursodeoxycholic acid daily without immunosuppressive therapy. She had no significant past history of pulmonary or genital tuberculosis. She had given birth to a son and a daughter.
Physical examination showed a blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg; regular pulse at 84/min; and a body temperature of 39.6 C. Superficial lymph nodes were not palpable. Chest examination revealed basal breathing. The patient's abdomen was distended, and peristaltic sounds were not audible. Edema of the extremities was present. The initial laboratory data for blood (Table 1) rendered a high C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 15.68 mg/dl. Her tuberculin test was negative.
CT scan of the chest showed bilateral pleural effusions without lymph node swellings. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed massive ascites with multiple septa. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a thickened intestinal wall located in the sigmoid colon (Fig. 1) and pronounced enhancement of the peritoneum. There were no masses or lymph node swellings in the abdominal cavity. Esophagogastroscopy and ileocoloscopy revealed no ulcer or stenosis in the colon or ileum.
The nature of ascites was revealed by puncture and findings are listed in Table 2, including a protein level of 4.6 g/dl. Microscopy was requested for malignant cells and Mycobacterium, neither of which was discovered. The cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of stool and urine as well as from bronchial lavage were negative for M. tuberculosis, but the culture of ascites returned positive for M. tuberculosis after three weeks.

He had a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the left upper and lower lobes, metastasis to the ipsilateral lung and femur, home oxygen therapy, etc. He was followed-up for the lung cancer at another hospital. At the time of admission, there was right lower abdominal pain. Blood test findings showed high inflammation, normal range of tumor marker levels obtained CEA, ProGRP, and CYFRA. Chest-abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an existing squamous cell carcinoma in the left upper and lower lobes (Fig. 1). The appendix was swollen, with a maximum diameter of about 20 mm, with an increased concentration of surrounding fat tissue, a finding of acute appendicitis. Nodules were found near the cecum, mesentery, peripancreatic area, dorsal side of the left kidney, etc., and were considered to be metastases or dissemination (Fig. 2). Because of his advanced age, history of many previous illnesses, and the fact that he did not want emergency surgery, he was followed-up with conservative treatment. He was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with antibiotics was started. Two days later, he vomited and the blood test showed relapse of inflammation. It was getting worse even in CT, emergency surgery was performed with the consent of the patient.
A midline incision was placed about 10 cm above and below the navel. A perforation was confirmed in the middle of the appendix, and an abscess had formed around the appendix. A white nodular structure near the cecum was considered to be the cause of the perforated appendicitis. The abscess wall and the small intestine were adhered to each other. No nodules were found on the abdominal wall or pelvic floor, but white nodules were also scattered in the mesentery. Cecal resection was performed, the operation time was 83 min, and the blood loss was 98 g.
Examination of the resected specimen showed that the appendix was thickened overall, with a white nodular structure at the root and a perforation in the middle (Fig. 3). Histopathologically (Fig. 4), atypical cells formed large and small tumor vesicles in the thickened appendix wall, and the tumor cells proliferated invasively, centering on the proper muscle layer. On immunostaining, the results were p40(+), CK (cytokeratin)5/6(+). The final diagnosis was acute perforating appendicitis caused by metastatic squamous cell carcinoma from the lung.

PMC4430206_01,PMC4430206,Female,64.0,"A 64-year-old woman presented to our department for evaluation of an asymptomatic mass on her left hard palate.
Intraoral examination revealed a 30 x 23-mm mass in the left hard palate's submucosal region with intact overlying mucosal tissue (Fig. 1a). Computed tomography and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging were performed. The results showed a homogeneous mass with well-delineated margins and pressure bone resorption of the hard palate (Fig. 1b-e). There were no other oral lesions or lymph node abnormalities.
We initially suspected a benign or low-grade malignant tumor, such as pleomorphic adenoma of the left palate, but an incisional biopsy specimen of the lesion did not confirm this or any other diagnosis. Histological findings revealed minimal lymphocytic infiltration in the stroma of the minor salivary glands. These findings were insufficient to distinguish between a lymphoproliferative disorder and MALT lymphoma. Therefore, we determined to excise this lesion under general anesthesia.
Pre-procedure blood tests revealed no unusual hematological or biochemical data. As the correlation of MALT lymphoma with Sjogren's syndrome is widely reported, we measured the amount of secreted saliva and performed appropriate immunological tests. The patient had normal salivary secretion ability, and had normal ranges of SS-A/Ro antibody and SS-B/Ro antibody.
The intraoperative rapid diagnosis of the lesion strongly suggested MALT lymphoma. The tumor was resected with an adequate safety margin of 5 mm and the palatal bone touching the tumor was shaved off along with the bone bar (Fig. 2a, b). The palatal mucosal defect was reconstructed using artificial dermis (Terudermis ). At a follow-up examination 9 months later, no recurrence or metastasis was seen (data not shown). An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy failed to detect Helicobacter pylori or any other abnormal endoscopic findings.
Histopathological examination showed lymphocytic infiltrate between the lymphoid follicles. Hyperplasia was seen from the germinal center to the stroma under an oral squamous epithelium surface. This hyperplastic tissue was largely composed of centrocytes and centroblasts with infiltration of small lymphocyte-like cells (Fig. 2c, d). Particularly in the infiltrated area, the lymphoid follicle was irregularly expanded with irregular polarity. Small and medium lymphocyte-like cells and plasma cell-like cells were clustered relatively densely between the follicles. Lymphoepithelial lesions or Dutcher bodies were not observed in the fibrous tissue partitions and salivary gland tissues (Fig. 2c, d). Immunohistochemistry revealed positivity for CD20 (Fig. 2e) and CD79a between the lymphoid follicles. CD10 and bcl-2 positivity were observed only in the germinal center cells and nongerminal center cells, respectively. CD3 (Fig. 2f) and CD5 positivity were observed in the T-lymphocytes between follicles. Since CD138, Igkappa, and Iglambda were positive in some cells, we assumed no immunoglobulin light chain restriction. A few plasma cells between lymphoid follicles were positive for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG4 (<40%). In addition, the positive Ki-67 ratio in cells between follicles was about 10%. Based on these histological results, MALT lymphoma was strongly suspected; however, the diagnosis was atypical follicular and interfollicular hyperplasia because of the lack of tumor cell clonality (Fig. 2).
Finally, we ordered a molecular analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chains using the FFPE sections of a postoperative sample. We performed PCR using extracted DNA from the materials and observed a monoclonal peak of VH(FR1)/JH, VH(FR2)/JH, and VH(FR3)/JH immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement on capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 3). The final diagnosis was MALT lymphoma of the hard palate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4430206/,6,images/PMC4/PMC443/PMC4430206_01
PMC10204752_01,PMC10204752,Female,74.0,"The patient was a 74-year-old woman who found a giant mass in the mediastinum during a routine examination before surgery on her right breast lesion (ductal carcinoma in situ). The mediastinal lesion resection was performed one month after breast surgery (February 2022). The patient had no cough, expectoration, dyspnea, chest tightness, or chest pain before the operation. No MG or other related symptoms were evident. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a giant mass located in the anterior mediastinum, with a size of 149 mm x 107 mm. Upon enhancement, the mass was in a cystic-solid pattern with a clear boundary, and the septa and calcification can be seen. The tumor protruded to the right chest cavity, and the adjacent lung was severely compressed (Figure 1A and B). 
A partial thymectomy with video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. A giant mass with a maximum diameter of 15 cm was resected. In gross, the tumor was encapsulated and the cross-section revealed multilocular cysts, which were measured 0.5-6 cm in the greatest diameters. The cysts were filled with pink-brown fluid. Solid gray-white lesions were in irregular shape and the maximum diameter was 7 cm.
Microscopically, the inner side of the cysts lacked epithelial cell lining and there were hemorrhage, calcification, cholesterol crystal cracks, and edema within cavities (Figure 2A and B). The fibrous septa varied in thickness and contained epithelioid cells with a small number of scattered lymphocytes (Figure 2C). In the solid area, the epithelial cell nests were deposited in the background of spindle cells, presenting a biphasic differentiation with scattered lymphocytes (Figure 2D). Both types of cells were bland-looking and small nucleoli can be seen in epithelial cells. No perivascular spaces or Hassall's corpuscles were found. 
Immunohistochemistry was performed. CK-pan (Figure 2E), P63 (Figure 2F), and E-cadherin were expressed in epithelial cells. The spindle cells were positive for Vimentin (Figure 2G) and EMA. Neither type of cell expressed CD20 (Figure 2H), and the Ki-67 index was less than 5% (Figure 2I). A small number of CD3 and CD5 positive T lymphocytes can be evident. However, these lymphocytes were all negative for CD1a, TdT, and CD99.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the YAP1 and MAML2 break-apart probes and YAP1-MAML2 fusion probes were performed with a FISH detection kit (HealthCare Biotechnology, Wuhan, China). It was found that the separation signal of YAP1 (Figure 3A) and MAML2 (Figure 3B) were both over 20%; YAP1-MAML2 fusion-positive signal is more than 10% (Figure 3C). Accordingly, the final diagnosis was rendered as metaplastic thymoma with multilocular-cystic formation. With no further treatment, the patient survived without evidence of recurrence for 12 months.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10204752/,14,images/PMC1/PMC102/PMC10204752_01
PMC7399447_01,PMC7399447,Female,36.0,"A 36-year-old woman presented with the complaint of occasional headaches since one year ago that has exacerbated since one week before the presentation and accompanied by blurred vision. She had no significant past medical or drug history. As the physical examination was unremarkable, brain MRI without gadolinium-based contrast agents was requested, which revealed a large, low-signal, heterogeneous mass in T2 and T1 MRI sequences in the right frontal lobe, extending to the right parietal lobe, and with significant midline shift to the left. To determine the nature of the mass, MRI with contrast injection was performed, showing a peripheral, punctuated enhancing lesion. Given the imaging findings, the differential diagnoses of low-grade glioma and brain lymphoma were rendered (Figure 1). The patient underwent craniotomy and the tissue sample was sent for histologic examination. Macroscopic examination showed multiple fragmented, pale-blue tissue fragments with elastic consistency, resembling cartilage, and totally measuring 8 * 8 * 3 cm. Primary microscopic examination described a neoplastic lesion with cartilaginous lobules and the appearance of whorls and gave the final diagnosis of metaplastic meningioma, WHO grade I. As radiology did not correlate with pathology, the specimen was sent to a neuroradiologist and a neuropathologist for second opinion. The neuroradiologist described a huge intra-axial mass in the frontoparietal area with compression and midline shifts that was non-contrast enhancing. The diagnosis of meningioma and hemangiopericytoma was excluded radiologically as they are contrast-enhancing and the definite radiologic diagnosis was not given. Examination of the specimen by the neuropathologist described a mesenchymal neoplasm, consisting of chondroid lobules without atypia, or necrosis. There was no evidence of brain parenchyma or dura (Figure 2A). As there was no brain tissue or dura in the specimen, the possibility of specimen displacement in the operating room was suggested. However, there was no related surgery in that day. To determine the exact nature of the mass, immunohistochemical staining for EMA, CK, GFAP, and S100 markers was performed, which was positive for S100 and negative for the other three markers (Figure 2B). The final diagnosis was intracranial chondroma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7399447/,5,images/PMC7/PMC739/PMC7399447_01

He also gave history of nasal obstruction with occasional epistaxis. His past medical and surgical history is non-contributory. He had the habit of tobacco, betel nut chewing for the past eight years. He had also undergone uneventful extractions.
Extra oral examination revealed a diffuse swelling on the left side of the face, in the maxillary region. The left infraorbital region was tender on palpation. Intraorally an ulcerated proliferative growth was seen on the left alveolar maxillary region in 24-27 region along with obliteration of buccal vestibule. The surface of the growth was covered with necrotic tissue with pus discharge and bleeding [Figure 1]. Limitation of mouth opening along with bilateral ulceration, bleeding and crust formation at angle of mouth was also observed. Generalized mobility of the teeth was also seen.
The OPG revealed a radiolucent area with bone destruction and obliteration of antrum on the left side. The CT scan revealed a huge enhancing lesion involving the entire left maxillary sinus causing erosion of its superior, medial, and postero-lateral walls, extending up to the nasal cavity, left ethmoid sinus and retro maxillary space [Figure 2].
Microscopic examination of the biopsy specimen revealed pleomorphic undifferentiated epithelial cells in the form of nests and trabeculae separated by thin fibrous connective tissue septa [Figure 3]. The cells were of variable size and shape, large cells with amphophilic cytoplasm with round to oval diffusely hyperchromatic nuclei with or without small nucleoli are seen interspersed with cells which have vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli [Figure 4]. Very few areas of squamous cells were appreciated along with areas of necrosis and increased mitotic activity.
Immunohistochemical assay revealed immunoreactivity of the neoplastic cells to cytokeratin (CK7, 8, 19) [Figure 5] and epithelial membrane antigen. The tumor cells were negative for S-100, vimentin and neuroendocrine markers. Thus, the final diagnosis was Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma.

PMC7708872_01,PMC7708872,Female,42.0,"A 42-year-old female patient presented to the hospital with a worsening retrosternal pain and shortness of breath on moderate efforts that started two weeks before. Her past medical history included hysterectomy for leiomyomatosis two years earlier. As propaedeutic procedure for pelvic pain she had recently performed abdominal ultrasound that showed a left peri ovarian solid mass. Surgery for resection of the mass could not be performed due to the current symptoms of cardiovascular disease.
She had no other significant prior history. She denied smoke, alcohol intake or substance abuse. She had no oncological familiar history.
Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) was excluded by computed tomography (CT) angiography. A transthoracic echocardiography performed in the emergency room revealed a large mass located in the right ventricular cavity and apparently adhered to the interventricular septum, right ventricle (RV) enlargement, a probable thickening of the tricuspid sub valvar apparatus, severe tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary systolic arterial pressure of 35 mmHg and normal left ventricle (LV) dimension and systolic function (Fig. 1). In order to provide additional characterization of the mass a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed and confirmed two large and independent masses, both with tissue characterization pattern compatible with tumour and located in the right ventricular cavity. The largest one, measuring 5.3 x 2.7 cm, was adhered to the anterior face of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and was responsible to a significant RVOT obstruction. The second mass was multilobulated, pedunculated and mobile attached to the interventricular septum. Moderate global systolic deficit (estimated ejection fraction of 39%) was reported, attributed to the RVOT obstruction (Fig. 2).
After the magnetic resonance result, she was submitted to a cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass for tumours resection. The surgery was performed by median sternotomy, with cannulation of the aorta, superior and inferior vena cava. Anterograde cardioplegia was made. Intraoperatively, a third small neoformation was identified heavily incorporated to the ventricular face of the anterior leaflet and to the chordae of the tricuspid valve (Fig. 3). The masses were completely excised with sacrifice of the tricuspid valve. A valve replacement was mandatory. The surgery was performed with no complications and the immediate postoperative course was uneventful. Furthermore, the postoperative control transthoracic echocardiography showed the normal functioning tricuspid valve, without any obstruction of the RVOT and preserved systolic function of both ventricles (Fig. 4).
Pathology of the cardiac masses revealed findings consistent with a benign smooth muscle neoplasm.
Histologically, the tumour was a mesenchymal neoplasm compatible with leiomyoma, no mitosis, areas of necrosis or signs of malignancy were found. The segment of the cardiac valve in the specimen had normal histological appearance.
Immunohistochemically, tumour cells were positive for smooth muscle desmin and caldesmon; and estrogen, supporting a gynecological leiomyoma lineage.
As the patient had a previous diagnosis of a periovarian solid mass, she was referred to the gynecology team and was submitted to a magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis. It revealed a large mass next to the left ovarian. She was submitted to a laparotomy nine days after the cardiac surgery and the mass was resected. Microscopic pathology revealed a leiomyoma, without atypia, mitosis or necrosis. She recovered from the second surgery without complications and was discharged from the hospital followed by the gynecology service. The final diagnosis was benign metastasizing leiomyoma to the right ventricle and pelvic.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7708872/,2,images/PMC7/PMC770/PMC7708872_01

At the medial distal third of the right femur, a large protrusion was present ( Figure 1 and Figure 5). Radiographic images showed bifid femur with fibular agenesis ( Figure 6), absence of right 3, 4, 5 metatarsals and phalanges, absence of left 4, 5 metatarsals and phalanges of foot ( Figure 7), left lateral X-ray showing caudal (sacrococcygeal) agenesis ( Figure 8). Initial diagnosis was made when the parents brought the child to the out-patient department concerned about limb abnormality at the age of 3 months and the final diagnosis was made following admission to the in-patient unit at 5 months, based on both clinical presentation and radiological images.

PMC4898009_01,PMC4898009,Female,84.0,"We present a case of an 84-year-old woman who had a longstanding history of anemia attributed to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic renal insufficiency, and chronic iron deficiency. She presented with complains of dyspnea, left flank discomfort and left lower quadrant abdominal pain. Her past medical history was significant for coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. She was status post coronary artery by pass graft, right sided carotid artery endarterectomy, right hip and knee replacement, total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral oophorectomy and hemorroidectomy. She had been receiving multiple blood transfusions. Colonoscopy, an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and a capsule endoscopy done in the past did not reveal any ultimate source of blood loss.
Abdominal CT obtained after oral and intravenous contrast agents, was successful in depicting a mild circumferential bowel wall thickening in the terminal ileum (Fig. 1). The involved intestinal wall ranged in maximum thickness from 1.0-2.5 cm and the length was 5-10 cm. The lesion showed diffuse homogeneous enhancement with isoattenuation. No definite mural involvement was noted. There was some dilatation of the intestine without perforation. The radiologic findings were interpreted as suspicious for a neoplastic process. Follow up colonoscopy was performed and biopsies were taken from terminal ileum and the ascending colon. The pathologic diagnosis was 'small bowel mucosa with acute ulceration and focal changes consistent with ischemia'. There was no evidence of malignancy.
Her clinical course was complicated by progressive increase in requirement for blood transfusions, and recurrent urinary tract infections. She presented a year later with increasing right lower abdominal pain, generalized weakness, dyspnea, and anemia. Her hemoglobin was found to be 8.7 mg/dl and hematocrit of 28.3. Previously, she required transfusion once every five to six months since her diagnosis of MDS. For the past one year, she was transfused eight units of blood.
Contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed an interval increase in the circumferential thickening of the bowel wall, involving a 10-15 cm length of distal ileum. The lesion now ranged in maximum thickness from 2.0-4.5 cm and showed diffuse homogeneous enhancement with isoattenuation. Mucosal ulceration and mural involvement was present without obvious perforation or stranding of mesenteric fat (Fig. 2). Non-bulky scattered lymphadenopathy was also demonstrated. It was localized, involving the small bowel mesenteric and pericolic lymph nodes. The diameter of the short axis of the lymphadenopathy was larger than 10-mm. No peritoneal or omental involvement was noted. Low attenuating lesions were seen in the liver ranging in size from 0.5 to 2 cm, which showed ring enhancement on post contrast images consistent with metastatic disease.
Follow up colonoscopy revealed a large ulcerated friable mass in terminal ileum. The initial impression was lymphoma or an adenocarcinoma. Serum Tumor Markers Chorioembryonic Antigen (CEA) and Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were within normal limits. The preoperative histopathologic diagnosis was consistent with histiocytic sarcoma.
Partial ileocolectomy and appendectomy was performed along with the lymph node dissection. The resected specimen consisted of a 24 cm segment of the terminal ileum and 13 cm of cecum. Findings at gross examination indicated an irregular ulcerated infiltrating mass involving the distal ileum measuring 10.0 cm in maximum dimension (Fig 3). The lesion extended to the ileocecal valve but did not appear to involve the colon and appendix. The cut surface showed a relatively well-circumscribed, solid, variegated gray to yellow tumor extending to the small bowel serosa. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were identified in mesenteric and pericolic fat measuring 0.5 to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension.
Microscopic examination showed full thickness infiltration of small bowel wall by malignant tumor composed of many sheets of spindle to epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, oval to irregular nuclei, vesicular chromatin, and large nucleoli (Fig. 4a). There were interspersed bizarre multinucleated cells, xanthomatous histiocytes and inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes and plasma cells (Fig. 4b). Mitoses ranged from 1 to 10 per 10 HPF. Necrosis was not present. The tumor cells were positive for leukocyte common antigen CD45 (LCA), CD45RO (UCHL-1), CD68 (KP1), CD4 (a T-cell antigen present in a subset of histiomonocytic cells), HLA-DR, vimentin, and lysozyme (Fig. 5 a-c). Smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, melan A, CAM5.2, CKAE1/AE3, EMA, S100 protein, CD1a, CD2, CD5, CD20, CD21, CD30, CD 34, CD35 and CD117 (c-kit) were negative. The final diagnosis was 'histiocytic sarcoma'. All of the regional lymph nodes were involved. The liver biopsy from the right lobe lesion was also similar to the primary ileal tumor.
The patient was started on adjuvant chemotherapy with ifosfamide, mesna, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine. She received the same therapeutic regimen two times. Each treatment lasted 5 days, with an interval of 21 days. A postoperative CT was performed about one month after the operation, which revealed multiple intra abdominal fluid collections/abscesses.

PMC6663103_01,PMC6663103,Male,52.0,"A 52-year-old male presented to the emergency department with the sudden onset of sharp, left lower quadrant abdominal and flank pain while at work. In the emergency department, he was noted to be afebrile with a pulse of 58 beats per minute, an elevated blood pressure of 141/84 mmHg, and an otherwise unremarkable physical examination. Laboratory data revealed blood urea nitrogen of 14 mg/dl, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl and normal urinalysis. There was no prior history of hypertension or clotting disorders, but he described his occupation as an air traffic controller as being very strenuous, requiring rapid twisting and turning of his abdominal area on a daily basis.
His medical history was significant for the parallel quality of abdominal pain that occurred two years previously on the right side. At that time, a non-contrast computed tomogram (CT) suggested acute appendicitis for which he underwent an appendectomy. However, the pathology report revealed a normal appendix. After two months of persistent pain, he obtained a second evaluation at a tertiary academic center, which showed a wedge-shaped infarct of the right kidney on contrast CT. In addition, a renal angiogram demonstrated multiple infarcts of the right kidney without evidence of a definite vascular etiology, and a normal left renal kidney. Eventually, his pain gradually subsided.
In order to diagnose the recent presentation of left-sided abdominal pain, a contrast-enhanced CT angiogram was performed, which confirmed a new left kidney infarct with a focal area of decreased perfusion at the lateral aspect. The left artery to the upper pole showed a focal area of narrowing near the hilum with distal dilation and possible dissection within it. The right kidney showed a small focal area of scarring in the mid pole and a focal area of cortical loss. These findings were consistent with a dissection in the renal artery branch supplying the upper lobe of the left kidney (Figure 1).
In order to identify the underlying etiology of the RAD, the patient subsequently underwent a chest CT angiogram, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, all of which were normal. In addition, evaluation for thrombotic diathesis was negative; review of radiological films uncovered no evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia, atherosclerosis or vasculitis and skin biopsy was unremarkable. The final diagnosis was bilateral isolated spontaneous RAD and he was started on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for persistently elevated blood pressure. However, no surgical intervention was deemed necessary and anticoagulation was not started. An iothalamate renal clearance showed glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 57 ml/min.
Follow-up at our facility one year later showed an improvement in ambulatory blood pressure. The patient reported earlier symptoms of lightheadedness, which necessitated discontinuation of his antihypertensive medication. His GFR had improved to 73.7 ml/min and repeat CT scan noted normal bilateral renal arteries without evidence of dissection. The right kidney was noted to have 2-3 wedge-shaped areas of cortical loss, and the left kidney showed small wedge-shaped areas of cortical loss in the lateral aspect and mid-portion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6663103/,1,images/PMC6/PMC666/PMC6663103_01
PMC4802134_01,PMC4802134,Female,84.0,"An 84-year-old female who lived alone was transferred to our surgical department from sub-acute care with worsening lower abdominal pain, having recently undergone an open anterior resection and loop ileostomy for diverticular disease. The pain was sharp, constant, and gradual in onset with a sudden worsening on the day of presentation. There was a raised white cell count (33.8 x 10 x 9/L). She was commenced on routine deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with 5000 units of dalteparin daily.
Her past history includes osteoarthritis, chronic kidney disease, type two diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive airways disease and peripheral vascular disease.
On examination there was lower abdominal tenderness with diffuse voluntary guarding. The patient was afebrile, but clinically and biochemically jaundiced. The stoma was functional. CT showed a complex gallbladder with an enhancing mural nodule/hypervascular blush. The lumen was filled with heterogeneous density material (Fig. 1). Two possible collections were noted near the rectal stump. Intravenous antibiotics and pantoprazole were commenced.
The patient developed prolonged melena and haematemesis, and required six units of packed red blood cells. Her lower abdominal pain settled with antibiotics, but then a new abdominal pain developed, localized to the right upper quadrant, in addition to her jaundice and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
Investigations aimed to characterise the lesion seen on the CT scan and identify the source of bleeding. They included an abdominal ultrasound, (showing an avascular heterogeneous mass, and predominantly hypoechoic material with cystic spaces within the gallbladder); MRCP (showing biliary tree dilatation to the porta-hepatis where there was evidence of high grade obstruction, gallbladder distension, and fluid extending into Rutherford-Morrison's pouch); and a gastroscopy (demonstrating an incidental small, superficial D1 ulcer with no active bleeding, and blood in D3). The patient was not tested for H. Pylori during the admission, nor treated for the ulcer, and is awaiting further follow up for investigation and management of this.
The initial presentation was one suggesting two concurrent pathological processes. The jaundice suggested a biliary disease, and this was reinforced by the abnormal gallbladder on CT scan at admission, however her initial pain was consistent with the para-rectal collections also seen on CT. The patient was accordingly treated with antibiotics for the collections. The development of the right upper quadrant pain prompted attention primarily towards the biliary tract.
A combination of these secondary symptoms and investigation findings, led to the localisation of the pathology to the gallbladder. The heterogeneous material in the gallbladder as seen on CT scan reinforced this. The initial impression was one of haemorrhagic cholecystitis, with the bleeding secondary to gallbladder inflammation.
Cholecystectomy and cholangiogram were performed with the view that the bleeding was originating within the gallbladder and that biliary compression was secondary to extrinsic bile duct compression by the distended gall bladder (as there was no convincing pre-operative evidence of intra-ductal obstruction).
The gallbladder was distended and was inadvertently entered during the dissection, with a clot and organised haematoma expressed (Fig. 2). Intra-operative cholangiogram was normal re-enforcing the impression of extrinsic biliary tract compression. The specimen was opened and a small ulcerative lesion noted (Fig. 3).
Histopathology demonstrated an 81 x 45 mm gallbladder with active chronic cholecystitis and mucosal ulceration. There was a 2 mm calibre artery seen at the ulcer base.
The final diagnosis was a dieulafoy lesion of the gallbladder with mild chronic cholecystitis. The obstructive jaundice was due to extrinsic compression of the common bile duct by the distended gallbladder.
Post-operatively the patient's condition rapidly stabilized and improved due to the surgical removal of both the source of blood loss and biliary tree compression. Review at four weeks post surgery revealed a well patient. She was discharged from clinic, and is currently awaiting reversal of her ileostomy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4802134/,3,images/PMC4/PMC480/PMC4802134_01
PMC2821394_01,PMC2821394,Male,49.0,"A 49-year-old Caucasian man developed a cough in early 2004. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, confirmed by thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan. He had no other symptoms. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered, but his symptoms were thought insufficient to warrant treatment.
In July 2004, he developed numbness and pain behind the right knee which gradually spread to the lower back, right buttock and posterior thigh. Upon examination he had reduced sensation over the lateral border of the right foot, an absent right ankle tendon reflex and a positive Lasegue's sign at 70 . He also had a dusky discolouration of the skin of the right foot.
He was admitted to our hospital in September 2004 because of progressive worsening of the symptoms. Lumbrosacral spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an increased heterogeneous signal within the S1 nerve root and of the nerve root ganglion on T2 images, thought to be due to oedema, with right piriformis wasting. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained no white cells, 0.52 g/l protein and 0.36 g/l glucose. Nerve conduction studies and an electromyogram (EMG) revealed abnormalities in the S1 segment, consistent with an S1 radiculopathy. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (sACE) was persistently normal but an isotope-labelled gallium scan showed increased bilateral lung hilar and lachrymal gland uptake. He developed skin nodules on his right thigh which, when biopsied, were confirmed as erythema nodosum. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered overwhelmingly likely, and in the absence of compression, the involvement of the S1 root was thought most likely due to neurosarcoidosis. He started treatment with prednisone 30 mg/day but his pain persisted; intravenous steroids and then local steroid nerve root injection was tried with temporary benefit. In April 2005, he started methotrexate (up to 12.5 mg per week) because of persistent pain and the need to lower his steroid dose because of his elevated glucose levels.
In November 2005, he developed left peri-orbital and hemicranial headache, followed by diplopia on left gaze. He was found to have a partial left sixth nerve palsy and was re-admitted. MRI showed thickening and gadolinium enhancement in the left cavernous sinus with no parenchymal change. Repeat gallium scanning showed normal lung hilar and lachrymal gland uptake. Serum rheumatoid factor, plasma viscosity, C-reactive protein, urea and electrolytes, liver function, clotting, auto-immune profile, protein electrophoresis, acetylcholine receptor antibodies, anti-neuronal antibodies, anti-thyroid antibodies, creatine kinase and ACE were all normal. He was treated with a three-day course of intravenous methylprednisone and experienced significant improvement.
The following month, he developed headache and further diplopia and he was found to have a painful pupil-sparing left third nerve palsy. His CSF was again entirely normal, including negative oligoclonal band assay. Brain and orbit MRI scanning were normal. EMG and nerve conduction studies suggested improvement of S1 radiculopathy. He also complained of left facial pain with tearing of the left eye. There was a patchy decrease in sensation on the left side of the face and scalp. Corneal reflex was diminished. Blink reflex and facial nerve conduction studies showed an afferent defect on the left suggesting a left trigeminal ophthalmic division neuropathy. His prednisone was increased to 60 mg/day, and cyclophosphamide was started instead of methotrexate. However, after reducing his steroids to 40 mg/day, severe facial pain recurred.
In March 2006, he developed numbness and tingling on the left side of his face, and was found to have a left maxillary ophthalmic division Vth neuropathy. A month later he developed a lower motor neuron left seventh nerve palsy and numbness in the right shoulder and in the left thorax. His CSF was again normal and/or negative including cytological study, acid-fast bacilli staining, and fungal and Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures and sACE was also still normal. His blood count showed mild lymphopenia and macrocytosis. Lactate dehydrogenase was normal. Borrelia, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, HIV and human T-lymphotropic virus Type 1 serology were negative. An ophthalmological examination was normal with no signs of granulomata.
At this stage, new neurological symptoms developed while the patient was on treatment with steroids and cyclophosphamide. Because no diagnosis emerged other than sarcoidosis, alternative immunosuppressive therapy was administered. Intravenous immunoglobulins, however, had no impact. Infliximab was added in June 2006. Despite this, the patient's right shoulder became weak, his headache persisted and he also developed unsteadiness of gait and significant weight loss. He now had bilateral seventh nerve palsies with weakness of the left palate, right serratus anterior, right triceps, left triceps and left finger abductors. All the upper limb deep tendon jerks were absent. A left vocal cord palsy was noted. EMG and nerve conduction studies showed abnormalities compatible with a pre-ganglionic lesion at C5 and C6 level (right), but no generalised neuropathy. Repeat brain MRI scanning showed enhancement of the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth cranial nerves (Figure 1). Spine MRI scanning was normal. MRI scanning of the upper brachial plexus was normal. A CT scan of the pelvis and abdomen were normal. A whole body fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan was normal. Urine thallium screening and lead level were negative. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was normal.
The patient then developed three subcutaneous nodules, one in the left outer inferior breast quadrant, without lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the nodules showed lymphomatous change, and the final diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving cranial and peripheral nerves (neurolymphomatosis). Bone marrow was normal.
He was transferred to the Oncology department and treated with chemotherapy including methotrexate. After chemotherapy he received total body irradiation and a bone marrow stem cell transplant. There was no significant improvement in his neurological condition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821394/,2,images/PMC2/PMC282/PMC2821394_01
PMC7489156_01,PMC7489156,Male,77.0,"A 77-year-old retired male patient referred to our clinic with complaint of swelling and redness in his left leg. He had the diagnosis of cellulitis at his leg and used cefazoline for two weeks. The cellulitis was healed clinically but then he was consulted to our clinic with swelling and hyperemia localized at his knee which was performed total knee arthroplasty (TKA) three years ago. Pain, swelling, hyperemia and limited range of motion were observed in the left knee during physical examination. He had a history of consumption of unpasteurized milk. There was no direct contact to pets or any other animals. A written informed consent was obtained from the patient.
Three aspirations were performed. One aspiration was positive. The antibiogram demonstrated antibiotic sensitivity against trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, linezolid, clindamycin, erythromycin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, levofloxacin and penicillin. Then, the final diagnosis was established based on the adaptation of the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria (Table I):
1. One positive culture 2. High C-reactive protein (CRP) (11.21 mg/L) & erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (57 mm/h) 3. More than 90% polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) in synovial fluid 4. Leukocyte esterase strip test showed 2+
The SD was identified in the first sample (Figure 1). The aspiration sample was inoculated to aerobic and anaerobic blood culture tubes (Becton-Dickinson, New Jersey, USA). Also, some of the sample was reserved for gram staining and direct inoculation to blood agar (Salubris Inc. Pharmaceuticals, Istanbul, Turkey), eosin methylene blue agar (Salubris) and chocolate agar (Salubris). The samples were incubated in 37 C for 18-24 hours in carbon dioxide medium. In gram staining, gram-positive cocci were seen. The blood culture tubes demonstrated signals for cultivation by day six. The cultivated bacteria were identified as SD using conventional and automatized systems (Vitek  2 Compact, BioMerieux, Craponne, France). The antibiogram for the identified species were determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria. For further identification and confirmation, Vitek  MS (MALDI- TOF) (BioMerieux) was used and the subspecies were identified as SDSE.
The case was considered as hematogenous spread of infection and as suggested in PJI consensus meeting, thorough debridement of the synovial sheath was performed and polyethylene insert was adapted. Postoperative antibiotic treatment was continued with third-generation cephalosporin for two weeks and then stopped when the infection symptoms were relieved, the CRP and the ESR levels dropped down and presented a plateau (Figure 2). The patient was followed-up for 11 months without recurrent infection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7489156/,2,images/PMC7/PMC748/PMC7489156_01
PMC7184838_01,PMC7184838,Female,70.0,"A 70-year-old Japanese woman visited a hematologist for idiopathic thrombocytopenia. During follow-up, she had general fatigue and a persistent low fever. Her urine analysis and abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed pyuria and a left staghorn calculus (Fig. 1a). Thereafter, she was referred to our department for a further examination and treatment for her urinary tract infection.
On the day of her initial visit to our outpatient department, her serum C-reactive protein level was 12.34 mg/dL, white blood cell count was 11,400/muL, and serum creatinine was 0.52 mg/dL. We performed percutaneous nephrostomy for the treatment of her pyelonephritis (Fig. 1b). Thereafter, 2 g/day of ceftriaxone (CTRX) was administered intravenously for 9 days. Her fever reduced, and her inflammation markers decreased. The next month, she visited our department again for fever. CT revealed that her middle and inferior calyx had not been adequately drained (Fig. 2). Two additional nephrostomies were therefore performed. We washed each calyx every day and administered CTRX 2 g/day for 9 days. Inflammation slowly decreased, and thereafter, she left our hospital.
Three months after her initial visit to our department, she underwent open nephrectomy. Due to severe adhesion, the kidney was divided into two pieces and removed (Fig. 3). A pathologic examination revealed that the tumor was SCC accompanied by a cancer pearl (Fig. 4a, b). Foam cells were invading the renal parenchyma, suggesting xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. We were able to detect the area where the urothelial epithelium and squamous epithelium were mixed. This finding suggested that the tumor was derived from the squamous metaplasia due to the staghorn calculus. Immunohistochemical staining showed that GATA3 and P40 were negative, while CK5/6 was positive (Fig. 4c-e). Based on these findings, a diagnosis of SCC rather than urothelial carcinoma or renal cell carcinoma was made. As her kidney had been broken into two pieces, it was difficult to decide whether or not the surgical margin was positive. Her disease's T stage was assumed to be at least pT3. The final diagnosis was SCC of the left kidney, and after the operation, the serum SCC marker level was 4.8 ng/mL.
One week after surgery, while her laboratory data showed improvement, general fatigue and appetite loss progressed. Two weeks after the operation, CT revealed local recurrence of the tumor (Fig. 5a). One month after her surgery, she was readmitted to our department because of her severe appetite loss and malnutrition. CT demonstrated enlargement of the local recurrence near the left renal hilum (Fig. 5b). At this point, her serum SCC marker level was 32.2 ng/mL.
Her general condition continued to worsen, and she was unable to receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Therefore, she received best supportive and palliative care. Two months after the operation, she died of renal SCC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7184838/,3,images/PMC7/PMC718/PMC7184838_01
PMC8415166_01,PMC8415166,Male,26.0,"A 26-year-old Chinese male with a firm palpable swelling mass (maximum size of 9.6 cm x 7.8 cm) around the right hip came to my hospital for medical help. Six months ago, he started a gradual onset of pain in the upper right femur without obvious cause. Plain radiography of pelvis (Figure 1) showed flake bone destruction in right femoral trochanter. To evaluate the lesion, computed tomography (CT) scan of the lesion (Figure 2) demonstrated poorly marginated bone destruction in the femerol head and neck. Moreover the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pelvis (Figure 3) presented a wide range capsule-patterned bone destruction of right femoral head and trochanter.
Through a combined series of radiological examinations and patient's clinic manifestations, tuberculosis was first considered due to its widespread in China. A T-SPOT test of the patient revealed a high value of 159.20 g/ml (reference range: 0-14 pg/ml). No lesions were found on the first lung CT scan, and the diagnosis of bone tuberculosis was made. Then antitubercular therapy with the rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol was administrated. After half a month of treatment, the local pain in the right hip of the patient was not relieved, and the palpable mass gradually increased and new fever symptoms appeared. One month after antitubercular therapy, the full blood test revealed a slight increase in the percentage of neutrophils and eosinophils, and the ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) values increased to 94 mm/h and 87.28 mg/l, respectively. A CT-guided needle biopsy of the lesion obtained an immunohistochemical report of CD68+ and CD163+, which indicated the presence of M2 macrophage. But the following application of antibiotics therapy did not relieve any symptoms.
Out of suspicion of some malignant bone tumors, the patient was discontinued with the antitubercular drug administration and transmitted to the hospital. The whole-body positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) demonstrated a very high fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (SUV max 8.0) in the upper segment of the right femur (Figure 4) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that a large cauliflower-like tumor tissue completely eroded the right articulation coxae (Figure 5). No similar lesions were found in the lymph nodes or any internal organs. In the following open surgery biopsy, the lesion tissue showed a gray and white fish-meat-like appearance, involving the articular cavity of the right hip joint. Variably shaped cells with abundant and pale cytoplasm were interspersed in a background of necrotic tissues upon histological examination. These cells presented prominent atypia (Figure 6). According to the REAL classification, these morphological and immunohistochemical features are consistent with peripheral T cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS).
Since no involvement of lymphoid tumor cells was suggested in the staging of bone marrow biopsy, the final diagnosis was primary bone lymphoma, which was classified as stage-IBE (Ann-Arbor staging). The patient's revised-International Prognostic Index (R-IPI) score was 1 (the patient's beta2-microglobulin level and lactate dehydrogenase level remained normal reference) which indicated a good prognosis.
After four rounds of chemotherapy including a standard CHOP-like regimen, two cycles of ITE (Ifosfamide, Pirarubicin, and Etoposide), and an HD-MTX (high dose methotrexate) regimens, the regional metastatic lymph node was confirmed by biopsy at the 9th month of his onset, so two additional regimens including gemcitabine and cis-platinum were conducted. After chemotherapy, the tumor did not shrink significantly, and clinical symptoms such as fever, pain, and fatigue persisted. Due to his poor response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy was recommended. The patient received a total of 50 Gy of local radiotherapy and then claimed that the local pain and fever had ceased. But half a month later, the pain got worse. It was further recommended that patient adopt the treatment plan of amputation or bone marrow transplantation, and if the patient refuses resection treatment. While waiting for a bone marrow match, radiological evidence showed multiple metastatic lesions in his lungs at the 15th month of his onset (Figure 7), and the patient died 2 months later.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415166/,1,images/PMC8/PMC841/PMC8415166_01
PMC7260585_01,PMC7260585,Male,59.0,"A 59-year-old man with a 3-month history of worsening chest pain and shortness of breath was referred to the pulmonary clinic. He had a history of 82 pack-years of tobacco use. He had no notable medical history. On presentation, his oxygen saturation level was 96%, and his lungs were clear to auscultation. Physical examination showed no remarkable findings other than left precordial tenderness. Serum cytokeratin 19 fragment, pro-gastrin-releasing peptide, and neuron-specific enolase were elevated (3.7 ng/ml, 115.3 pg/ml, 14.8 ng/ml, respectively), whereas other tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen, and sialyl Lewis X, were all negative. Serum markers for interstitial pneumonia were not elevated (KL-6, 101 U/ml; surfactant protein-A, 21.3 ng/ml; surfactant protein-D, 25.1 ng/ml). Pulmonary function tests revealed airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC, 62.8%) and reduced diffusion capacity (%DLco, 34.2%; %Kco, 38.0%). Chest CT revealed low attenuation areas, suggesting emphysema and diffuse GGOs along with interlobular septal thickening in both lungs (Fig. 1). Bronchoscopy revealed no obvious abnormalities in the lumen, and bronchoalveolar lavage from the right B5 showed no abnormal findings. Interstitial lung disease was initially suspected; however, transbronchial lung biopsies obtained from multiple lesions showed an adenocarcinoma with a signet-ring morphology (negative for surfactant apoprotein-A, TTF-1, and Napsin A, and positive for CDX-2, cytokeratin 7, and cytokeratin 20) that infiltrated the alveolar septa in all specimens (Fig. 2). The tumor cells contained abundant intracellular mucin. Gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an ulcerative tumor in the stomach. A biopsy of the tumor demonstrated malignant cells with similar morphology and immunophenotype as those in the lungs. The final diagnosis was diffuse lung metastasis from gastric cancer. The patient refused chemotherapy because his performance status worsened and he hesitated the side effects of systemic chemotherapy. At the patient's request, he was transferred to hospice care.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7260585/,1,images/PMC7/PMC726/PMC7260585_01
PMC8247731_01,PMC8247731,Female,78.0,"A 78-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to our hospital with a 3-month history of progressive numbness in both lower extremities and gait disturbance. Neurological examination on admission showed mild paralysis of both lower limbs (manual muscle test: right 2/V; left 4/V) and pronounced numbness in the right lower limb. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a solid mass with clear borders in the dorsal medulla oblongata, appearing hypointense on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and T1-WI (WI), and hyperintense on T2-WI, with strong enhancement on gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T1-WI [Figure 1]. Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed a low-attenuating lesion in the same region. Cerebral angiography did not show any vascular abnormalities. Neither whole-body CT nor chest X-ray revealed any obvious abnormalities, including bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy [Figure 2a]. No dissemination was evident on MRI of the whole spinal cord [Figure 2b]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed moderately elevated levels of both protein (227 mg/dL) and lymphocytic cells (52/muL), while concentrations of various markers including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2-R) remained with normal limits. However, beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG) was slightly elevated. Preoperative differential diagnoses included malignant glioma, malignant lymphoma, metastatic tumor, and infectious or inflammatory diseases. To confirm the histological diagnosis and plan effective treatment for the primary disease, we performed surgical biopsy of the enhanced lesion under a midline suboccipital approach with image-guided navigation [Figure 3a]. Intraoperative findings demonstrated that this lesion was gray to yellowish in color and extremely firm without bleeding [Figures 3b and c]. Histopathological examination with hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrated noncaseating granuloma consisting of epithelioid cells [Figure 4a] with infiltration of macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and lymphocytes [Figure 4b-d]. Taken all these results into account, the final diagnosis was sarcoidosis limited to the medulla oblongata. Corticosteroid therapy was started with prednisolone as a therapeutic maneuver at the same time for diagnostic purpose. Three months after starting that treatment, MRI showed a marked reduction in the size of the Gd-enhanced lesion on T1-WI [Figures 5a-c]. The perioperative course was uneventful, and numbness in both lower extremities and gait disturbance resolved gradually. The patient remained clinically stable, and all residual lesions had completely disappeared in MRI by the 1-year follow-up [Figures 5d-f].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8247731/,12,images/PMC8/PMC824/PMC8247731_01
PMC7869746_01,PMC7869746,Male,6.0,"A 6-year-old, mixed-breed, 24-kg, neutered dog, with a 2-month history of a progressive weakness, loss of appetite, productive cough, abdominal distension, and difficulty in breathing, was selected for the treatment. Complete blood count (CBC) and biochemical tests were assessed. Thoracic radiographs detected severe pleural effusion and bilateral middle and caudal lung lobe collapse. Abdominal radiographs and ultrasound also evidenced severe effusion. Serosanguinous fluid was removed from the pleural and abdominal spaces, underwent cytological examination, and showed high malignant characters (anisocytosis and anisokaryosis). Ultrasound-guided biopsies were taken from the pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum, and histological and immunohistochemical diagnoses were performed; the final diagnosis was of mesothelioma.
Autologous adipose tissue, obtained by lipoaspirate from the dog's lumbar flanks, was microfragmented by using a microfragmentation device (Lipogems, Italy) as previously described. This procedure allows minimal manipulation without the use of enzymatic procedures, and microfragmented samples can be also cryopreserved or used as a scaffold for paclitaxel (MFAT-PTX). For our study, fresh aliquots of microfragmented adipose tissue were loaded with PTX by adding the drug at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and stirring the mixture for 30 min before use as previously reported.
Treatment protocol consisted of ultrasound-guided administration into the abdominal and thoracic cavity of 7 ml of MFAT-PTX (1 mg/ml) corresponding to 0.29 mg/kg (0.35 mg/m2) of free drug. First administration (T0) was done 15 days after presentation. Over the course of 22 months, the dog underwent 17 treatments (both intrathoracic and intra-abdominal), with an average of a treatment every 38 days (shortest interval 14 days, longest 70 days).
The procedure is initiated by drainage of the abdomen and chest from the exudate fluid followed by injection of 3 ml of MFAT-PTX intraperitoneally + 2 ml, respectively, into the right and left pleural spaces (Figure 1). Clinical outcomes were monitored at the time of each treatment and documented by thorax radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, clinical examination, and blood counts. Special attention was given to eventual adverse effects.
The minimal parameters of PK [Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, volume of distribution (Vd), and area under curve (AUC)] were evaluated by checking the amount of drug in the blood 30 min and 2, 4, and 8 h after the first treatment of the MFAT-PTX. At the 10th treatment (T10), the residual amount of the drug was also measured in the pleura and pericardium biopsies. The amount of PTX was evaluated by liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis as already reported. Briefly, blood (100 muL) and tissues (about 50 mg) were added in internal standard (25 mul of paclitaxel D5 10 mug/ml) and PTX was extracted by 1 mL of a mixture methanol/isopropanol (6:4, v:v). Dry extracts were redissolved with 200 mul of acetonitrile and 10 mul injected in LC-MS/MS. The details for instrumental conditions were already described elsewhere and kept essentially unaltered.
No major short- or long-term adverse effects were registered. Complete blood counts and biochemistry performed each month did not show abnormalities. In particular, during the whole treatment leukocytes and platelet counts in the peripheral blood indicated constantly normal values, suggesting an absence of systemic myelotoxicity. All phases of the treatments were feasible. In order to avoid iatrogenic damage to the internal organs, major attention was given to the intracavity administration when a low amount of effusion was present.
The dog presented rapid improvement in its general conditions after each exudate fluid drainage, followed by the intracavitary administration. This effect lasts for an average period of 30-40 days.
Notably, in the first 15 months of treatment the intervals between treatments were longer (average 52 days) while in the last 7 months the intervals between treatments were shorter (average 24 days).
The patient presented good clinical conditions during most of this period. During the final few days before each treatment, exudate formation became visible, and the clinical conditions worsened.
Evaluation of the clinical status was based on the periodical veterinarian controls in which exudate fluid formation was assessed by ultrasound, radiographs, and computed tomography scan (CT) together with breathing quality. Both parameters presented clear amelioration. Notably, the abdominal exudate production completely ceased after the fourth treatment. In addition, the owner's evaluation was taken into consideration, as they had knowledge of the dog's ""normal"" vs. ""abnormal"" behavior. The owner reported a good quality of life. The dog was able to play with other dogs, go up the stairs, and coughed rarely, breathed normally most of the time, and had a good appetite.
Post-treatment thoracic radiographs, performed once a month in the first 6 months, showed progressive reduction of the severe pleural effusion (Figure 2). The following radiographs, every 3 months, evidenced only mild differences in the thoracic effusion quantity while in the abdominal cavity no liquid could be detected. The first thorax and abdominal CT scan, pre- and post-contrast medium, performed 8 months after the initial treatment evidenced mild to moderate pleural effusion, rare abdominal effusion, pleura and peritoneum reactivity, and loco-regional lymphadenopathy. A control CT after 12 months showed only mild difference (Figure 2).
The patient was euthanized after 22 months due to worsening of his clinical conditions and underwent a complete post-mortem exam. Macroscopically all the pleural surfaces presented isles of yellowish fatty material, identified as MFAT-PTX (last administration 2 weeks previously) (Figure 3). Cytological smears of pleural and peritoneal effusion were evaluated, presenting overlapping findings: hematic background with scattered eosinophilic material, good cellularity, and mixed cellular population; and presence of numerous cells in clusters of small/medium size, having variable cytoplasm nucleus/cytoplasm ratios, slightly basophilic cytoplasm with occasional vacuolization, round/oval central or paracentral nucleus with coarse chromatin, and prominent central nucleolus. The cells present moderate to severe malignancy characters, including anisocytosis and anisokaryosis and presence of occasional leukocytes.
A biopsy of pericardium was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained routinely with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections (30 mum) placed on Superfrost Plus slides (Superfrost  Plus) with an automated immunostainer (Discovery Ultra-Roche). The primary antibody was a monoclonal anti-mouse mesothelial cell clone HBME-1 (Dako cod M3505) diluted 1:100 and incubated at room temperature for 20 min.
Histopathological sections of pericardium and pleura were examined with focal evidence of a neoplastic cellular component within the pleura engorging dilated vessels. Cells were round to polyhedral and arranged in small groups or micropapillae. The nucleus had a cytoplasmic ratio that was intermediate. The cytoplasm moderate and eosinophilic, and the nucleus was round to oval with 1-2 nucleoli. Anisokaryosis was marked and anisocytosis moderate. Mitosis were 0-2 in 10 high-power fields (400 x). Immunohistochemistry for the HBME-mesothelioma marker confirmed the mesothelial origin of the cells (Figure 3).
After treatment with MFAT-PTX, no drug was detected in the blood at 30 min. At 2, 4, and 8 h, the amounts detected in plasma were 28.8, 19.25, and 4.89 ng/ml, respectively (Figure 4). Cmax was 28.8 ng/ml, Tmax = 2 h, and the half-time (T1/2) = 5 h. Based on the dose of PTX injected and the plasmatic Cmax, we estimate an apparent volume of distribution at 2 h (Vd2h) of 243 liters. The calculation of plasmatic AUC 1-8 h demonstrated that MFAT-PTX treatment makes available the drug in plasma with a value of 117 ng*h/ml. The residual amount in pleura and pericardium measured at 30 days after the 10  treatment by HPLC suggested the presence of 3.6 and 13.3 ng/g, respectively, which, by considering the weight of these tissues, can be evaluated as a residual drug of about 2.16 mug in the pleura and 3.99 mug in the pericardium.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869746/,7,images/PMC7/PMC786/PMC7869746_01
PMC3891084_01,PMC3891084,Male,35.0,"A previously healthy 35-year-old male complained of intermittent fever and myalgia of 1-month duration. On admission, he was febrile (39.2C), with painful tenderness of the edematous upper arm; however, the overlying skin had no grossly abnormality. Ultrasonography showed a diffusely increased echogenicity in his thickened triceps, brachialis and gluteus muscles. Therefore, a magnetic resonance imaging study was performed (Figure 1).
A confirmatory muscle biopsy was performed on his left triceps and brachialis muscles. These histological specimens showed severe myositis, with predominantly dense infiltration of mature neutrophils, associated disruption of the muscle architecture and tissue necrosis (Figure 2). Microbiological studies and serology for auto-antibodies were negative.
The initial complete blood count revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 20,440/mm3, with a differential count of 7% segmented neutrophils, 22% lymphocytes and 40% blast cells, which were strongly suggestive of leukemia. The serum chemistry studies disclosed an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level of 977 U/L. The patient subsequently underwent a diagnostic bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, which showed replacement of the normal bone marrow with myeloblasts. The flow cytometric findings were positive for CD13, but negative for CD33, CD14 and HLA-DR. Cytogenetic studies showed a normal karyotype (46,XY[20]). PCR of AML1/ETO was negative. On the basis of the flow cytometry and cytogenetic studies, the final diagnosis was confirmed as a M2 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia, with paraneoplastic neutrophilic myositis. Concomitant treatment with corticosteroid and induction chemotherapy was started. The fever, myalgia and swelling of both the upper arms were resolved after 5 days of steroid therapy.
An ultrasonography after 6 weeks of therapy demonstrated resolution of the muscle swelling seen at diagnosis. After the induction chemotherapy, and 2 courses of consolidation, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, hematological remission was maintained for 15 months. The lack of stem cell sources limited the salvage therapy for the first relapse due to chemotherapy. At present, the patient is on close follow-up in the third hematological relapse.

PMC8565681_01,PMC8565681,Female,50.0,"A 50-year-old woman presented in our hospital in September 2016 for a mass in the left breast, self-detected by palpation 3 months before. The menarche installed at 15 years, the last menstruation was in February 2016.
The family oncologic history revealed the presence of ovarian cancer in the case of her mother, diagnosed at 63. Local clinical examination identified a fixed mass against the underlying tissues, measuring 10/11 cm in the left breast with an inflammatory aspect of the gland, with skin invasion; in the right breast, at the junction of the internal quadrants, a fixed mass measuring 5/6 cm was also objectified. After performing a mammogram (Figure 1), breast ultrasound and elastography, breast MRI (Figure 2), the diagnosis was bilateral luminal B breast cancer - invasive carcinoma NST, Nottingham II, ER= 70%, PR= 3%, HER2= 1+(negative), Ki67= 40%, in the left breast and invasive carcinoma NST, Nottingham II, ER= 60%, PR= 1%, HER2= 0 (negative), Ki67= 50%, in the right breast.
The brain, thoracic, abdominal and pelvic CT scan showed no metastasis. The final diagnosis was of left breast invasive carcinoma NST, luminal B, cT4dN0M0, stage IIIB and right breast invasive carcinoma NST, luminal B, cT3N0M0, stage IIB.
The multidisciplinary team decided to proceed with neoadjuvant sequential chemotherapy based on 4 cycles of anthracyclines and 4 cycles of taxanes, which achieved partial response. A recommendation for genetic testing had been made, but the patient postponed it until 2017.
Systemic treatment was followed by bilateral modified radical mastectomy and laparoscopic bilateral adnexectomy (in order to avoid goserelin in adjuvant setting). Intraoperatively, bilateral ovarian tumors and miliary lesions of the peritoneum were objectified. Immunohistochemical test for these lesions revealed WT1 and PAX8 positivity, suggesting the ovarian origin and infirming a possible breast cancer metastasis. The pathology report concluded with the diagnosis of left breast tumor - ypT0N0 (0/16) and right breast tumor - ypT0N1 (2/15) and high grade serous ovarian carcinoma stage IIIB (ypT0N1aM1L0V0R0).
One month after surgery, the CT scan showed no residual tumors or metastasis. She received adjuvant external radiotherapy on both hemithoracic walls to a total dose of 50 Gy/ 25 fractions.
Because the surgery for ovarian cancer was bilateral adnexectomy alone, the first intention was to complete the procedure with hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. According to the surgical report, R0 was impossible to achieve at that time due to peritoneal extension. Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on platinum and taxanes was initiated (9 cycles) in parallel with adjuvant endocrine therapy (Letrozole) for breast cancer.
Imagistic evaluation at 3 months was performed in order to assess the best time for curative surgery with multiple resections performed in order to obtain complete response during the systemic treatment.
The PET-CT 6 months after the first surgery reported an active area (SUVmax=7.2) at the level of a mesogastric intestinal loop, one the left lower quadrant of the abdomen (SUVmax= 9.7), with a reticular infiltration of the peritoneum in the left upper quadrant and the mesentery (Figure 3).
Genetic tests were performed from a blood sample in October 2017 and a BRCA1 germline mutation was identified (Cys61Gly). This variant is a common cause for breast and ovarian cancer in individuals of Eastern European ancestry. No other family members were tested. Chemotherapy was stopped in November 2017 after three laparoscopic exploratory interventions in order to assess the possibility to obtain clear surgical margins (at every 3 cycles) but, unfortunately, the disease showed transthoracic extension. Observation and close follow-up were considered the best option. One year after surgery the patient presented with an altered general health status, bradylalia, dysarthria and left hemiparesis.
Brain CT showed a left cerebral peduncle posterior pontin lesion (23/16 mm) with perilesional edema, most likely of breast origin in the context of normal ovarian tumoral marker CA-125 values (12.1 U/ml) and the known affinity for brain tissue of the breast cancer (Figure 4).
Palliative whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) was performed to a total dose of 30 Gy/10 fractions. At the end of the WBRT, the patient was still bradylalic with left hemiparesis. Through an early access programme, a PARP inhibitor (olaparib 150 mg BID) was initiated. A partial response by RECIST 1.1 criteria (60% reduction) was obtained after 3 months (Figure 5).
After 6 months the patient presented with bradylalia, balance disorders and hemiplegia of the right lower limb, CT scan showing a lesion of 23 mm (Figure 6).
Second line chemotherapy with taxanes and bevacizumab obtained a complete radiologic response (Figure 7) and also clinical benefit after 4 cycles (Figure 8).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8565681/,7,images/PMC8/PMC856/PMC8565681_01
PMC2654436_01,PMC2654436,Female,48.0,"A 48-year-old Chinese female with HBV infection for 15 years was regularly followed up at gastroenterology outpatient department by abdominal ultrasound (US) and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) screening every six months. In May 2005, abdominal US demonstrated a low echoic nodule, 1.6 x 1.6 cm in size in the sixth segment of the liver and mild parenchymal liver disease (Fig. 1A). She was asymptomatic and no abnormality was disclosed by physical examination. Noncontrast liver computed tomography (CT) showed a 1.6 x 1.6 cm well-circumscribed and low density nodule in the same liver segment (Fig. 1B). Dynamic CT scans showed enhancement of the nodule in the arterial phase and early washout in the portal phase (Figs. 1C and 1D). Serum was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but negative for HBeAg. The serum anti-HCV was also negative. AFP and CEA were within normal range. Based on the imaging findings and underlying HBV infection, small HCC was highly suspected and a US-guided liver biopsy was performed for definite diagnosis. However, the pathological finding suggested a malignant neoplasm originating form neuroendocrine cells (Fig. 2A). The result of immunohistochemical (IHC) stain was positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), synaptophysin, and chromogranin A (Fig. 2B). The pre-operative 24-hour urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) value was within normal limits. We undertook a more thorough investigation to rule out the possibility that the liver tumor was a metastatic carcinoid. This workup included upper and low GI endoscopy, a small bowel series, abdominal US, and chest and abdominal CT scans. All imaging findings were unremarkable. Partial hepatectomy was performed. Small bowel, appendix and large bowel were checked during operation and no tumor was found. No cirrhotic liver was noted. The surgery was performed successfully and the patient recovered well. The resected liver tissue contained a 1.6 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm circumscribed tumor (Fig. 3). Histological examination revealed the round or ovoid neoplastic cells arranged in insular pattern with a rosette formation. There was no tumor embolus in the vessels and the resection line was free from tumor invasion. The IHC stains were positive for chromogranin A, cytokeratin, NSE, and synaptophysin. The final diagnosis was PHCT. She was followed up regularly at our hospital and remained disease-free 3 years after operation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2654436/,7,images/PMC2/PMC265/PMC2654436_01
PMC5496329_01,PMC5496329,Male,59.0,"A 59-year-old male, known diabetic and hypertensive for the past 5 years and on medications, presented with a history of breathlessness on exertion for the past 2 months. There was no history of chest pain, cough, palpitations or syncope. On examination no significant findings could be elicited. Laboratory investigations and complete haematological profile was within normal limits (no features of hypercoagulable disorders). Echocardiography showed dilated right atrium and right ventricle with impaired right ventricular systolic function. The pulmonary valve appeared thickened with possible mass attached to it, with turbulence and gradient in the main pulmonary artery. A contrast enhanced CT was performed which revealed a hypodense filling defect in the main and bilateral pulmonary arteries which did not exhibit any significant post contrast enhancement (Fig. 1). Based on the clinical and radiological findings a diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism was made and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy was planned. Under GA, midline sternotomy was performed and main pulmonary artery was opened. Grey white organised mass with thrombosed areas was removed by separating it from the main pulmonary artery, bilateral pulmonary artery branches and pulmonary valves. On histopathology the tumor was composed of spindle to epithelioid cells exhibiting moderate to marked pleomorphism with vascular growth pattern and prominent areas of intratumoral haemorrhage and fibrinoid necrosis. Interspersed were mitotic figures and areas of focal myxoid change showed features of high grade sarcoma involving the media and intima and the lumen of the pulmonary artery with epithelioid morphology (Fig. 2a, b). On Immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were diffusely positive for Fli1 (Fig. 2c), which is a surrogate vascular marker; focally weakly positive for CD31, while were negative for CD34. Tumor cells were negative for SMA, desmin and H-caldesmon (myogenic/myofibroblastic markers). The final diagnosis was primary pulmonary artery high grade sarcoma and the suggestive histogenesis was vascular (angiosarcoma).  
The immediate post-operative period was uneventful. Two-month post-surgery patient present with on and off pleuritic type of chest pain and was referred to our tertiary care centre for further management. As a part of the work up, Cine-cardiac MRI was performed which showed non-enhancing altered signal intensity lobulated mass in the left pulmonary artery with both exophytic and endophytic intravascular component (Fig. 3a-d). CT was performed to rule out pulmonary metastatic disease however CT thorax revealed ill-defined focal patchy pneumonic areas in bilateral lung parenchyma that were in favour of pulmonary changes as a sequel to chronic thromboembolic phenomenon (Fig. 3e, f). In view of the progressive residual disease patient was treated with definitive external beam radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions; dose per fraction: 200 cGy). During the course of treatment patient had occasional haemoptysis which resolved spontaneously. Follow-up imaging after 12 cycles of radiotherapy revealed significant progression of the primary disease with new development of pulmonary parenchymal metastasis (Fig. 4). In view of the disease progression with short disease free interval period the patient is currently treated with metronomic therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5496329/,1,images/PMC5/PMC549/PMC5496329_01
PMC8565682_01,PMC8565682,Male,30.0,"We hereby present the case of a 30-year-old patient, with a normal weight (BMI=21 kg/m2), without significant personal or family medical history, with a 10-pack year history of smoking and occasional alcohol use, who addressed to the family doctor for a persistent infectious episode in the last 8 weeks accompanied by pain and swelling in the large joints. On this occasion, tachycardia was documented and he was addressed to our clinic for evaluation.
On arrival to our facility, the patient had fever (38 C). The physical examination revealed tachycardia, with a grade 2/6 systolic mitral murmur, mild perimalleolar edema and bilateral basal crackling.
The biological work up revealed inflammatory syndrome (WBC= 10,300/mm3, ESR= 24mm/h, Fibrinogen=610.7 mg/dL, CRP=41.1 mg/L), hepatocytolysis syndrome (ALT= 45 U/L, AST=73 U/L, GGT=67 U/L), mild hypoproteinemia (58.1g/L) and micro-albuminuria.
The ECG showed supraventricular tachycardia 150/min, inverted P waves in V1, suggestive for right atrial origin, positive P waves in inferior leads suggestive for a superior site of origin- possible right atrial tachycardia (Figure 1).
Transthoracic echocardiography showed a globally enlarged heart, with severe impairment of left ventricular ejection fraction and diffuse hypokinesia (ejection fraction of 20% by the Simpson biplane method) (Figure 2). There were also moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitations, with and estimated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure of 30 mmHg and a small posterior pericardial effusion.
Given the initial ECG aspect, a tachycardiomyopathy was taken into consideration. We used beta-blocker (Carvedilol 6.25 mg bid) and Ivabradine 7.5 mg bid, in order to slow down the heart rate and elucidate the ECG aspect. After reaching a more convenient heart rate, the ECG showed sinus rhythm, biphasic P waves with prolonged duration (120ms), which is diagnosis for an advanced interatrial block with left atrial retrograde activation (Bayes syndrome) (Figure 3). As an alternative when the ECG during tachycardia is unclear, adenosine injection and vagal maneuvers may help in clinical diagnosis.
At this point in the investigation, we began to search for specific etiologies for the DCM, but only after making sure that we are not facing secondary heart failure etiologies, such as coronary heart disease, hypertensive heart disease or valvular heart disease. Hypertension was excluded and the valvulopathies mentioned above were interpreted as functional. The coronary computed tomography (CT) angiogram excluded an ischemic heart disease (Figure 4).
When discussing the underlying cause of the DCM, the following were taken into consideration: a genetic etiology, an infection leading to myocarditis, a systemic immune-mediated disease, toxic and overload, drugs, as well as a possible endocrine/metabolic etiology.
The genetic consultation ruled out a genetic condition. The cultures from the blood, urine, sputum, as well as the pharyngeal exudate were negative. The patient tested negative for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, syphilis and viral hepatitis. Surely, the possibility of a previous viral infection leading to myocarditis remained strong, therefore a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed, showing severe enlargement of the left ventricle (diastolic diameter 72 mm, systolic diameter 64 mm), moderate to severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 26%), with diffuse hypokinesia and impairment in both longitudinal and circumferential strain (-9% and -7%).
There were significant diffuse fibrosis of the interstitial space and an important increase of the extracellular volume, without edema, all of this being suggestive for chronic myocarditis (T2Map: 42ms, T1pre: 1280ms; T1post: 482ms, ECV: 33%). The right ventricle was slightly dilated with normal systolic function (EDV 203 ml, ESV 102 ml, EF 50%), but with impairment in both longitudinal and circumferential strain (-11 % and -6%). The left atrium was moderately dilated (56/47/51 mm, area 28 cm2) (Figure 5).
Given the AST/ALT =1.6, hypoproteinemia and microalbuminuria, a systemic pathology was suspected and therefore an autoimmune work-up was pursued. The serum antinuclear antibody (ANA) was positive (22.3 UA/ml) based on the anti-Ro/SSA antibodies (394 U/mL), but at that moment, neither the criteria for Sjogren's syndrome nor for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were fulfilled. Both toxic/overload and drug induced etiologies for dilated cardiomyopathy were excluded. The patient had no clinical/ paraclinical criteria for acromegaly or pheochromocytoma, and the thyroid work up was within normal limits (TSH=3.509 muUI/ml, FT4=1.37 ng/dl, Anti-TPO=16.2 UI/ml).
Therefore, the final diagnosis was DCM secondary to chronic myocarditis, and the patient received the treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, according to the current guidelines, with Furosemid 40 mg qd, Spironolactone 25 mg qd, Ramipril 2.5 mg qd, Carvedilol 6.25 mg bid and Ivabradine 7.5 mg bid.
During the first follow-up visit at 3 months, the patient described palpitations and the ECG revealed atrial fibrillation. In this context, we decided to stop the treatment with Ivabradine and initiate antiarrhythmic treatment with Amiodarone, with the restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm. The reevaluation of the left ventricle function showed no significant difference.
At 6 months distance from the initial diagnosis, the patient developed typical discoid lupus lesions localized on the bridge of the nose and the upper cheeks and the dermatological evaluation established the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and treatment with Azathioprine 50 mg bid, Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg bid was initiated.
The echocardiographic reevaluation at 9 months distance from the initial diagnosis showed little improvement of the ejection fraction (ejection fraction of 36% by the Simpson biplane method). The patient was asymptomatic.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8565682/,3,images/PMC8/PMC856/PMC8565682_01
PMC6739717_01,PMC6739717,Female,36.0,"A 36-year-old female arrived at the Emergency Department presenting a sudden loss of consciousness secondary to head trauma after falling from her own height on two episodes. After the second fall, the patient had loss of strength in the lower extremities leading to impaired ambulation. The patient had a sudden-onset disabling holocranial headache, aggressive behavior, and vertigo for the 2 weeks prior to her arrival at the Emergency Department. The patient did not have any symptoms related to an acute infectious process (e.g., fever or malaise). She sought out medical attention at a regional psychiatric hospital from which she was referred to our institution with a somatoform disorder and depressive episode diagnosis. The patient's family history included a father deceased secondary to type 2 diabetes and colon cancer complications; no other relevant aspects of family history were found. The patient denied the use of controlled substances, allergies, past blood transfusions, traveling to regions with endemic diseases within the last 3 months, tattoos, and body piercings. The patient had three pregnancies, three deliveries, and no cesarean surgeries, without any psychological or physiological complications with regard to her past obstetric history. She was diagnosed with major depression 18 months prior to admission to this hospital; however, she had no adherence to medical treatment and two previous suicide attempts within this time period.
Upon initial physical exploration, we found a recumbent patient with freely chosen body position, Glasgow coma score of 11 (i.e., eye-opening 4, verbal response 1, motor response 6), without focal neurologic deficits or meningeal sings, aware of her environment but with mutism, and without making verbal or eye contact. The patient's integumentary system was hydrated and without alterations. She had horizontal nystagmus associated with oculogyric crises, while the rest of the head and neck exploration had no alterations. Fundus examination was not performed due to the excessive saccadic eye movements. The musculoskeletal exploration revealed stereotyped movements in all four extremities, which had an onset of a couple of hours. The patient had normal plantar and other deep tendon reflexes. Cerebellar function and muscle strength were not evaluated due to the patient's lack of cooperation. Upon inspection, auscultation, and percussion the cardio-respiratory system had no abnormal findings. During thoracic palpation, a mass (2 x 2 x 3 cm, petrous consistency, and immobile) in the right axillar line was detected. No abnormalities were found on breast examination. Abdominal examination was without alterations. Upon admission, the patient had the following vital signs: blood pressure of 94/60 mm Hg; heart rate of 77 bpm; respiratory rate of 20 rpm; temperature of 36.5 C; body-weight of 60 kg; height of 158 cm; and BMI of 24.0.
The patient was evaluated by the psychiatry department confirming the somatoform disorder and depressive episode diagnosis, providing management with olanzapine and sertraline. The neurology department evaluated the patient to assess the sudden-onset movement disorder integrating an OMS. Initial diagnosis suspicion was post-viral cerebellar ataxia or neuroinfectious disease. Laboratory results at admission are presented in Table 1. A computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed to assess intra-axial lesions (e.g., hemorrhage, ischemia, and tumors) with normal findings. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal (Table 1). Management with alprazolam and magnesium valproate was initiated to address the psychomotor agitation and movement disorder. The urinalysis was compatible with a urinary tract infection (Table 2) which was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone. Blood, bronchial secretion, and urine cultures were performed, with all cultures reporting negative results. To exclude viral infection or drug use the following tests were requested: antibodies for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV, as well as urinalysis for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, cannabis, cocaine, methamphetamines, and opiates; all results were reported as negative (Table 2). Procalcitonin serum levels were 1.67 ng/mL. After an infectious etiology was excluded, an electroencephalogram was performed, yielding no epileptogenic or abnormal activity. In search of an autoimmune etiology, the following tests were requested: cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies, perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies, anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid, anti-cardiolipin IgG, anti-cardiolipin IgM antibody, and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, all reported as negative (Table 2).
Screening for a neoplastic process in the brain, magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. 1a, b) was performed, reporting normal results. The following tumor markers were screened and all were reported negative: alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, CA125, CA153, CA19.9, and carcinoembryonic antigen (Table 2). An axillary ganglion biopsy was performed reporting a high-grade and poorly differentiated malignancy (Fig. 2a, b). Immunohistochemical staining with cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CD 45, Cyclin D1, CD 117, smooth muscle actin-alpha, and BCL2 were all reported as negative, while staining for HMB-45, melan-A, vimentin, and S-100 were positive. The histopathological diagnosis was compatible with melanoma (Fig. 2c-f). In search of a primary site simple and contrasted thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic CTs were performed (Fig. 1c-f). No primary site or apparent lymphadenopathy were identified. The CT of the thorax showed lung parenchyma with areas of consolidation and images compatible with ground glass opacities and air bronchogram (Fig. 1c, d). To further search for a primary site a positron emission tomography (PET) was scheduled.
Seventy-two hours after admission, the patient developed type one respiratory insufficiency (i.e. vital signs: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg; heart rate of 120 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 rpm, temperature of 39 C; blood gas test arterial pH = 7.3, PaO2 = 50 mm Hg, PaCO2 = 30 mm Hg, HCO3- = 18 mEq/L, O2 content = 75%, base excess = -6 mmol/L; lactate = 0.9 mmol/L), thus requiring invasive artificial airway with an endotracheal tube and admittance to the Intensive Care Unit for further test and treatment. The patient had a torpid evolution characterized by purulent bronchial secretions, 39 C body temperature and increase in leucocyte count (Table 2). The microorganism Acinetobacter baumannii was isolated from the bronchial secretion (i.e. > 100,000 colony-forming units/mL). Intravenous colistimethate and meropenem were initiated. Due to the septic process, the PET imaging was not performed.
After 13 days of hospitalization, the patient presented extreme bradycardia (40 BPM), progressing to asystole. Advanced life support protocol was initiated and after 20 min without reverting the cardiac arrest the patient was pronounced deceased. Necropsy examination was performed by two independent pathologists reporting hemorrhagic lesions at the corpus callosum level, multiple paratracheal and perihilar lymph nodes (e.g. sizes ranging from 0.8 x 0.5 cm and 1.5 x 1.2 cm) (Fig. 3). The histological sections of the axillary, paratracheal and perihilar lymph nodes showed a poorly differentiated malignant neoplastic lesion constituted by pleomorphic cells, atypical nuclei with open chromatin, nuclear pseudo-inclusions, and mitosis (Fig. 2a, b, 3c, d). Immunohistochemical staining was performed and antibodies for HMB-45, melan-A, vimentin, and S-100 were positive (Fig. 2c-f). Both pathologists reached the same diagnosis and were unable to identify the primary site. The final diagnosis was melanoma metastasis from an occult primary cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6739717/,16,images/PMC6/PMC673/PMC6739717_01
PMC5247304_01,PMC5247304,Female,48.0,"A 48-year-old woman with a history of postpartum depression (no medications) with no coronary risk factors was first hospitalized 7 years previously (2009) following an episode of LOC at home and chest pain. She was diagnosed with heart failure with abnormal wall motion on transthoracic ECG manifesting as severe hypokinesis involving the apex. She was given guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure in the form of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, aspirin, and diuretic therapy. Four months later following improvement of her condition, coronary angiogram and echocardiography were performed in a UK center and both were reported to be normal, therefore all medications were discontinued.
Over the past 6 years she had infrequent syncope always after emotional stress, in 2010 again after a heightened emotional situation she had recurrent chest pain, LOC, and dyspnea at another institution. Echocardiography reported low LV ejection fraction (EF):40% with apical wall motion abnormalities:and hypokinesis. Medical therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, aspirin, and diuretics was introduced.
One year later (2011), she was seen in our cardiology clinic for follow-up and echocardiography once again revealed normal LV function with an EF of 55%.
Further emotional distress 1 year later (2012) resulted in repeated LOC. ECG and rhythm strips upon hospitalization (Fig. 1) showed marked repolarization abnormalities with symmetrical deeply inverted T-wave in anterolateral leads, prolonged QT interval (corrected QT interval, 554 milliseconds) and sinus bradycardia (51 beats/min).
Telemetry on the coronary care unit showed several episodes of TdP which on five occasions rapidly degenerated to ventricular fibrillation (VF; Fig. 2). Serum electrolytes, inflammatory markers, and pulmonary hypertension were normal and she was not receiving any QT-prolonging drugs.
She required electrical defibrillation and received magnesium sulfate and mexilitine. Additionally, beta-blockers were held for bradycardia. Repeat coronary angiography again demonstrated normal epicardial vessels and no coronary spasm.
On reviewing her history, we noted that before this event, as well as all previous events, she was under the same severe emotionally stressful situations after which she always experienced central chest pain followed by LOC.
Echocardiography (Fig. 3) revealed ballooning of the LV apex, akinesia of the midanterior and midinferior wall with hyperkinesis of the basal segments, and an LV-EF of 30%.
Internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD) implantation was decided for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death.
Four days later, while in hospital, repeat echocardiography revealed mild improvement of LV contractility with a rise in EF to 40%; however, there was a moderately sized LV apical thrombus (Fig. 4), hence anticoagulation was commenced. This soon resolved on repeat echocardiography 1 week later with marked improvement of LV contractility and once again normalization of LV function with an EF of 55% with resolution of the apical thrombus (Fig. 5).
Serial ECGs for 3 consecutive days displayed marked repolarization abnormalities with fluctuating prolonged QT intervals that failed to normalize. After a long discussion among all treating physicians, the electrophysiologist, and the patient, an ICD was implanted; thereafter, she was completely stable.
The final diagnosis was as follows: recurrent TTS complicated by LV apical clot, acquired LQT, TdP, and VF cardiac arrest. She was discharged home on guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure and she continues to have regular follow-ups. Echocardiogram repeated almost 1 year later revealed normal LV size and systolic function (EF, 55%) and there were no ICD therapies, heart block, or recorded arrhythmic events on device interrogation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5247304/,5,images/PMC5/PMC524/PMC5247304_01
PMC6503770_01,PMC6503770,Female,76.0,"A 76-year-old female patient presented to the department of oral pathology and microbiology with a chief complaint of difficulty in eating for the past 1 week. The patient also gave a history of pain in the upper right back tooth region for 8 months, following which extraction was performed due to the presence of periodontally compromised 16 and 17, after which the symptoms were temporarily relieved. On intraoral examination, a well-defined lesion approximately 2.5 cm x 1.5 cm in size with everted and slightly indurated margins was present on the edentulous alveolar ridge with respect to missing 16 and 17, which was extending to the vestibule. There were no symptoms of nasal regurgitation, but the patient presented with a nasal twang.
The patient was diabetic and was under medication for the past 8 months after extraction was done. Bilateral submandibular lymph nodes were slightly enlarged and mobile. Orthopantomogram showed irregular alveolar bone loss. Water's view depicted slight haziness in the right maxillary sinus and bone loss in the involved area. The patient complained of discomfort in the same region for the past 7 days and also submitted a piece of tissue which had been dislodged from the upper left back tooth region while eating. The tissue was immediately preserved, subjected to decalcification, processed and then histopathologically examined.
The decalcified sections of the hard tissue bit received showed abundant bony trabeculae with empty osteocytic lacunae, absence of osteoblastic rimming and prominent resting and reversal lines. Numerous fungal hyphae and spores of varying morphology were seen in the marrow spaces. Some fungal hyphae were broad, aseptate and ribbon shaped, showing branching at obtuse angles representing Mucorales species, whereas others were thin and septate, showing branching at acute angles representing Aspergillus species [Figure 1]. Fungal spores of varying sizes were observed, exhibiting budding at some places along with fruiting bodies of Aspergillus [Figure 1]. These were easily identified as Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus.
Numerous actinomycotic colonies were also noted along with other bacterial colonies, including both bacilli and cocci arranged in clusters as well as individually in close association with peripheral bony trabeculae [Figure 1]. Focal areas showed chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate comprising lymphocytes. A few small blood vessels, extravasated RBCs, areas of necrosis and vegetable matter were observed. Grocott's methenamine silver staining showed septate Aspergillus hyphae, aseptate Mucorales hyphae and fungal spores along with actinomycotic colonies [Figures 2-5]. The final diagnosis was given as chronic osteomyelitis associated with a combination of mucormycosis, aspergillosis and actinomycosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6503770/,2,images/PMC6/PMC650/PMC6503770_01
PMC10249131_01,PMC10249131,Female,35.0,"A 35-year-old woman was admitted to the Endocrinology Department of Erciyes University Medical School with an adrenal mass and uncontrolled hypertension. The patient's medical history revealed two genital reconstruction surgery in childhood (at the age of 3 and 15) and high blood pressure, which was first detected at the age of 12. In addition, she was given glucocorticoids in childhood. However, she did not use it regularly afterward and did not use it for the last 5 years. She had regular menses and did not describe any severe complaints in terms of hirsutism. There was consanguinity between her parents. At physical examination, there were hypertension, clitoromegaly, deep voice and mild hirsutism (Ferriman-Gallwey score 10). She took no medication except nifedipine, 60 mg/day, for the treatment of hypertension.
On laboratory evaluation, the patient had hypokalemia (2.7 mmol/L), high serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (279 pg/mL), 11-deoxycortisol (140 ng/ml), total testosterone (236 ng/dL), and androstenedione (> 10 ng/dL) levels. Although the clinical picture was not compatible, in order to exclude pheochromocytoma as a differential diagnosis of adrenal mass, 24-hour urinary free metanephrine and normetanephrine levels were measured, and their levels were 44 mug and 141 mug, respectively (normal ranges: 44-261 mug/24h and 111-419 mug /24h). Some other details of biochemical evaluation are given in Table 1. Classic 11betaOHD was diagnosed with her medical history, physical examination and laboratory evaluation.
Adrenal computed tomography showed diffuse-moderate thickening and hypodense nodular appearance in the right adrenal gland, while a hypodense nodular mass, 74x55 mm in size, was detected in the left adrenal gland (Fig. 1). Due to the presence of macroscopic fat densities in the mass, myelolipoma was considered as a preliminary diagnosis of the adrenal mass. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed, and the final diagnosis was myelolipoma, as expected. The patient is currently in her postoperative second year and has been receiving glucocorticoid replacement therapy (Hydrocortisone 15 mg/day). The patient does not have any complaints, and her blood pressure is regulated with glucocorticoid replacement and a single anti-hypertensive (Lercanidipine 20 mg/day). In terms of hormonal and biochemical aspects, serum potassium, 11-deoxycortisol, ACTH and androstenedione levels were within the normal range, and total testosterone was unmeasurably low (Table 1).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10249131/,2,images/PMC1/PMC102/PMC10249131_01

After several months of misdiagnosis, a workup including angio-CT revealed a suspicious mediastinal mass of 5 x 8 cm behind the right bronchus, parenchymal pulmonary micronodules, and a thickening of the diaphragmatic cupola with pleural and pericardial reactions. A PET-CT discovered a second right paravertebral focus and several suspect lymph nodes. A thoracoscopic biopsy was performed and a histopathological examination revealed the presence of a malignant tumor that did not express epithelial or lymphoid markers but expressed markers of soft and melanocyte tissues, including S100a, HMB45, NKIC3, and Melan-A. Furthermore, a BRAF v600e mutation was evidenced. The final diagnosis was metastatic melanoma.
A thorough dermatological examination was performed but no primary lesion was found. The patient presented a high number of halo nevi, suggesting that the primary lesion could have regressed.
The patient was a professional tattooist and his own cutaneous surface was extensively covered with different kinds of tattoos and colors.
After 4 months of combined treatment with dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor), he progressively developed an asymptomatic thickening and induration of several of his tattoos. There were no other skin signs. Clinically, the tattoos presented a 3-dimensional appearance (Fig. 1) and were slightly itchy. The histopathological analysis of a cutaneous punch biopsy revealed the presence of a histiocytic infiltrate grouped into small, nonnecrotizing, narrowly confluent granulomas associated with the presence of abundant black pigmentary deposits, both intra- and extracellularly, with an exogenous appearance (Fig. 2a, b, c). Strong potency topical corticosteroids were prescribed with a partial improvement of the pruritus but no improvement of the infiltration of the tattoos.

Four years previously she had a left breast lump biopsy which suggested ILC grade II with in situ component. She was cT3N2M0. Tumour was weak positive for ER and diffuse strong positive for PR. She underwent left modified radical mastectomy. Postoperative histology showed no evidence of residual tumour and 11 out of 16 lymph nodes dissected were positive. Subsequently, she received adjuvant chemotherapy with three cycles of 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide followed by three cycles of docetaxel. Following this, adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to chest wall and drainage areas at a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Simultaneously, she was started on tamoxifen. She was on regular follow-up from the breast clinic without any evidence of recurrence.
Physical examination at the time of admission showed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2 with bilateral pedal oedema. There was no pallor or lymph node enlargement. There was no evidence of local recurrence. The opposite breast and axilla were normal. An abdominal wall oedema was elicited with no other significant findings. Pelvic examination disclosed a hard mass of cervix obliterating the fornices and of restricted mobility. The first possibility of a second malignancy of cervix was considered clinically.
Further investigation with CT abdomen and pelvis showed moderate to gross ascites with irregular soft tissue stranding in the omentum. Bilateral irregular soft tissue density mass lesions noted in adnexa, on the right measuring 42 x 33 mm and on the left measuring 43 x 21 mm. (Figure 4). Para-aortic nodal mass seen as heterogenous conglomerate soft tissue attenuation. The stomach showed diffuse irregular wall thickening.
Endoscopic-guided biopsy of the stomach was done which was negative for malignancy. Ascitic fluid cytology revealed adenocarcinoma. A punch biopsy from the cervix mass showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with lobular growth pattern and occasional signet ring cells. (Figure 5). The metastatic tumour cells were strongly positive for cytokeratin and negative for E cadherin. Tumour cells exhibited immunopositivity for ER and PR similar to the initial tumour.
The final diagnosis was lobular carcinoma of the breast presenting with extensive metastases as bilateral adnexal masses, omental deposits, and hard cervix mass. She was started on second line chemotherapy with carboplatin and gemcitabine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4583243/,2,images/PMC4/PMC458/PMC4583243_02
PMC3779405_02,PMC3779405,Female,55.0,"A 55-year-old woman presented with a clinical history of hyperparathyroidism. An ultrasound of the thyroid gland revealed a right-sided 2.9 cm mixed echogenic nodule and a 0.6 cm isthmic nodule containing fine internal calcifications.
An ultrasound guided FNA of the right lobe was performed. Air dried smears were stained with Diff-Quik and ethanol fixed smears with Papanicolaou stain. The Diff-Quik smears showed abundant thin colloid and predominantly benign-appearing follicular cells arranged in monolayered pattern. However, other areas showed enlarged round to ovoid follicular cells with nuclear crowding and rare grooves [Figure 5]. Few follicular cells with occasional small nucleoli were also present [Figure 6]. No intranuclear inclusions were identified. Occasional multinucleated giant cells were present. The final diagnosis was atypia of undetermined significance (AUS). Although the Bethesda Recommendation for AUS is repeat FNA after a period of observation, based on the clinical presentation of patient and imaging studies, a total thyroidectomy was performed. The right lobe showed a 2.2 cm encapsulated nodule and two smaller ill-defined white firm nodules measuring 0.3 cm and 0.5 cm. No tumor was seen in the left lobe. Histologic sections from the 2.2 cm right lobe revealed a well-encapsulated tumor composed of colloid-filled macrofollicles occupying more than 50% of the nodule and admixed with smaller follicles. The epithelium of both small and large follicles showed nuclear overlapping, fine chromatin pattern, small eccentrically located nucleoli and few nuclear grooves. No intranuclear inclusions were identified. Capsular or vascular invasion was not identified. Immunohistochemical stain for HBME-1 was positive. The remaining two smaller nodules showed classic micropapillary thyroid carcinoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3779405/,2,images/PMC3/PMC377/PMC3779405_02
PMC3934770_01,PMC3934770,Female,76.0,"On June 5, 2012, a 76-year-old female patient was transported to the Intensive Care Unit of Mehr General Hospital (Tehran, Iran) via ambulance. She had a 3-week history of progressive somnolence, confusion, agitation, symptoms of depersonalization, and visual hallucinations. Her disorder began 12 weeks prior to her current admission, with daily and repeated short, sharp, lancinating, electric shock-like pain involving the left lower division of the fifth cranial nerve. She was taken to a local hospital in another city, where she underwent neurological evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), with normal results. The patient was instructed to take 200 mg carbamazepine 3 times a day, which partially relieved her pain episodes. Eight weeks later, and following attacks of nocturnal hallucinations, a neurologist prescribed 5 mg olanzapine to be taken each night. However, her mental and psychiatric state deteriorated, and she was transferred to Mehr General Hospital.
On physical examination, the patient was afebrile. Scars from a coronary artery bypass surgery performed in 2008 were present on her anterior chest wall. Her lungs were clear, and no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly was detected. Neurological evaluation revealed an awake, agitated, confused woman with garbled and incoherent speech. She was easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli and could not sustain attention. No carotid bruit or stiff neck was detected. Cranial nerves were grossly normal, and no sensory or motor abnormalities were detected in the fifth cranial nerve. Corneal, orbicularis oculi, and sneeze reflexes were intact. Her motor power was 5/5 in all 4 extremities, her deep tendon reflexes were 2/4 in the arms and 1/4 in the legs, she had normal flexor plantar responses, and no abnormalities were seen in gait or coordination.
Brain MRI, MR angiography, and MR venography were normal. EEG showed moderately diffuse slowing (fig. 1). A lumbar puncture was performed, and the results of the cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in table 1. To avoid any possible treatable diagnosis, intravenous phenytoin and acyclovir were started, but acyclovir was stopped 5 days later when the final diagnosis was achieved. Quetiapine was administered to keep the patient calm.
Blood tests showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (40 mm after 1 h; normal: <20 mm) with normal complete blood count, and low hemoglobin (10.6 mg/dl; normal: 12-16 mg/dl). Liver and kidney function tests and blood sugar levels were normal. Immunologic tests showed negative anti-Ro, anti-nuclear, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Serum protein electrophoresis and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were normal. Broad serological screening assays for infectious conditions, including HIV, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, hepatitis, Lyme disease, syphilis, and tuberculosis using the intermediate-strength purified protein derivative skin test, were negative. Tumor markers, including carbohydrate antigen (CA)-125, CA-19.9, CA-15.3, CA-242, carcinoembryonic antigen, serum alpha-fetoprotein, and anti-Ri and anti-Yo antibodies were not detected, but anti-Hu antibodies were present in the serum, as visualized by dot blot and indirect immunofluorescence techniques.
To localize the suspected malignancy, the patient underwent computed tomography scans of the chest and abdomen, which disclosed a large mass in the left ovary (fig. 2). She underwent surgery, and a 20-cm ovarian intestinal-type mucinous tumor (fig. 3) was removed. After surgery, the patient recovered quickly. After 2 weeks, she was alert and oriented with normal speech. Her second EEG at this stage was normal (fig. 4). Two months after the operation, the patient was pain-free, and her carbamazepine and phenytoin were gradually discontinued. At her last follow-up visit in March 2013, the patient was well and free of symptoms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3934770/,3,images/PMC3/PMC393/PMC3934770_01

On arrival, he was conscious and alert, with a blood pressure of 139/62 mm Hg, heart rate of 98 beats/min, temperature of 39.3  C, and a peripheral oxygen saturation of 97% at ambient air. There were no cardiovascular or respiratory abnormalities. Guarding and rebound tenderness were observed over the entire abdomen, particularly the lower quadrant. Laboratory tests revealed the following: white blood cells, 4500/muL with left deviation (neutrophils, 94.7%); C-reactive protein, 0.16 mg/dL; hemoglobin, 11.6 g/dL; platelet count, 5.2 x 104/muL; prothrombin time, 11.7 s; international normalized ratio, 1.04; total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.9 g/dL; aspartate transaminase, 51 IU/L; alanine transaminase, 36 IU/L; and serum creatinine, 0.81 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) revealed circumferential thickening of the cecum and a small volume of ascites in the pelvic cavity (Fig. 1). A diagnosis of peritonitis was made, and surgery was performed to identify the cause. Surgical findings included redness and thickening of the cecal wall and purulent ascites without intestinal contents. The abdominal cavity was washed, a drain was placed in the pelvic cavity, and postoperative intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated. The postoperative course was uneventful. Three days after surgery, peritoneal fluid culture revealed E. tarda as the sole pathogen. The final diagnosis was SBP associated with gastroenteritis caused by E. tarda.

She had been suffering from type 2 diabetes mellites for almost forty years and had Hashimoto's disease. She did not require insulin but was on oral antidiabetics and thyroid replacement therapy. There has been no history of drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes. However, her husband was a heavy smoker. She was 153 cm tall, and her body weight was 44.8 kg with body mass index (BMI) of 19.1 kg/m. Her abdomen was flat and soft. She had a dull tenderness in her right lower abdomen. She was not jaundiced. Main laboratory findings on admission revealed as follows: HbA1c 8.2%, free T4 1.13 ng/dL, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 4.19 iU/ mL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 4.7 ng/mL, carbohydrate associated antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) 200.6U/mL, s-pancreas antigen-1 67.9 U/mL. Contrast-enhanced CT showed an oval-shaped hypovascular tumor in the pancreatic body (diameter of 32 mm along with multiple nodules in the peritoneum). The final diagnosis was PC complicated with peritoneal dissemination (cT4, cNx, cM1, stage IV). She was under palliative care until she died 2 months later. The gross appearance of the abdomen at autopsy revealed hemorrhagic ascites, a cluster formation with adhesion by adjacent abdominal organs and tissues (Fig. 1), and dissemination of multiple white nodules in the peritoneum. Microscopic picture of the pancreas revealed a proliferation of cancer cells and abundant fibrosis.

She had a 40-year history of type 2 diabetes, and she was on oral antidiabetics but never required insulin. She also had Hashimoto's disease, but thyroid replacement was discontinued after normalization of thyroid hormone profiles in sera. She denied smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol. However, her husband was a heavy smoker. She was 149 cm tall and her body weight was 48 kg (BMI 21.6 kg/m). Physical status on admission was stable except tenderness in her upper abdomen. She was not jaundiced. She did not have hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, and there was no palpable mass in the abdomen. Main laboratory findings on admission revealed as follows: HbA1c 6.5%, free T4 1.15 ng/dL, TSH 0.96 iU/mL, thyroglobulin 77.10 ng/mL, thyroglobulin antibody 592.1 IU/mL, thyroid stimulating antibody 105%, thyroid peroxidase antibody 10.4 IU/mL, TSH receptor antibody 0.5 IU/mL, CEA 5.8 ng/ mL, CA19-9 80.9 U/mL. Contrast-enhanced CT and PET-CT revealed a tumor in the head of the pancreas at the diameter of 26 mm. The final diagnosis was locally advanced PC (cT4, N0, M0, stage III). She initially received chemoradiation therapy, but she finally chose palliative care alone. Although metallic stent was placed in the duodenum for duodenal stenosis followed by biliary stenting for obstructive jaundice, she eventually died 15 months after initial diagnosis. On autopsy, the gross appearance of the abdomen revealed some metastatic nodules in the liver (Fig. 3). Carcinoma arising from pancreatic head invaded into the duodenum and lower bile duct with respective stents remaining. The hemorrhagic change was found in gastrointestinal tracts and uterus presumably caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation. Microscopically the main tumor was diagnosed as well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma with a component of papillary adenocarcinoma and mucinous carcinoma (Fig. 4).
With regards to the familial tree of these two present cases, these two patients were a sibling. There were four patients with PC within the first-degree family (sisters, young brother, and father) (Flowchart 1). Notably, various cancers, breast cancer, were included in this family.

PMC9079230_01,PMC9079230,Male,72.0,"A 72-year-old patient (BMI:26Kg/m2) referred to our Endocrinology Unit for investigation of a 3.8 cm right adrenal mass diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound and thereafter by computed tomography (CT) because of abdominal pain that was subsequently resolved. He did not report night sweats or fever, dyspnea, or precordial pain. His-medical history included a diagnosis of hypertension and atrial fibrillation the last 10 years. On admission, a repeated adrenal CT scan showed large bilateral adrenal masses of 6.7 cm on the right adrenal gland compressing the inferior vena cava and of 3.7 cm on the left adrenal gland (Fig. 1A). There was increased precontrast CT attenuation (31-35HU), heterogeneous enhancement and no substantial contrast washout on delayed imaging.
The biochemical and hormonal work-up were unremarkable except for mild anemia (Hb 11.8 g/dl, Ht 36%, MCV 79fL, MCH 25.5pg) and mildly increased lactate dehydrogenase [LDH 299 U/L (NR:134-279 U/L]. The morning cortisol and adrenocorticotropin hormone levels were within normal range [324 nmol/L (NR:138-745 nmol/L), and 13 nmol/L (NR:10-60pg/ml), respectively]. Cortisol response after a Short Synacthen Test (0 min 274 nmol/L, 30 min 454 nmol/L and 60 min 789 nmol/L) excluded adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol after overnight dexamethasone suppression test (48 nmol/L) and aldosterone after saline infusion test (21.5 pmol/L) were suppressed excluding autonomous cortisol or aldosterone secretion. Twenty-four-hours urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine excretion were normal [220 mug/24 h (NR<341 mug/24 h) and 311 mug/24 h (NR<444 mug/24 h) respectively].
A systemic-metastatic disease was very likely and the patient underwent evaluation with thorax, CT scan that revealead a 4.6 x 5.5 x 2.6 cm mass in the right atrium wall which extends from the superior vena cava junction to the inferior vena cava junction. Subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the previous finding (Fig. 1B). Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. The CT-guided adrenal biopsy and the immunohistochemistry investigation revealed the presence of a DLBCL with triple expression of bcl2, bcl6, c-myc (+70%). MUM1 was positive and Ki-67 was 99% (Fig. 2). LCA, CD20, bcl2, bcl6, CD79a, PAX5 were positive, whereas CD3, CD5, CyclinD1, CD10, kappa/lambda, CD30 were negative. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for bcl-2, bcl-6 and c-myc oncogenes was performed on the adrenal biopsy, but results were unreliable due to technical reasons. The CNS International Prognostic Index (CNS-IPI) score was 5 suggesting an increased risk for CNS progression/reccurence. Virology tests for Epstein Barr virus and HIV were negative. Bone marrow aspiration, trephine biopsy and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were negative for lymphoma infiltration. Karyotype was normal and MRI brain spectroscopy was negative for CNS lymphoma detection.
A week later, a positron emission tomography (PET-CT) scan showed hyper-metabolic infiltrative masses involving the right atrium and both adrenal glands (Fig. 1C). The Deauville score was 5. The patient continued to be asymptomatic
The final diagnosis was primary extranodal lymphoma, DLBCL type, with cardiac and bilateral adrenal involvement, stage IVE.
Although there was not performed a biopsy of the infiltrative mass involving the right atrium, the clinical findings were compatible with lymphoma infiltration as the patient had neither thrombosis of the right atrium or infection. On the contrary, he was afebrile and CRP and d-Dimers levels were within normal limits.
Under the care of the hematology team, systemic immunochemotherapy with R-DA-EPOCH and high dose of methotrexate for CNS prophylaxis were administrated. The regimen was as follows: Rituximab 375 mg/m2 iv Day (D) 1, Etoposide 50 mg/m2 iv D1-D4, Doxorubicin 10 mg/m2 iv D1-D4, Vincristine 0.4 mg/m2 iv D1-D4. Prednisolone 60 mg/m2 iv D1-D5, Cyclophospamide 480 mg/m2 iv D5. Filgrastim amp sc 48IU, initiating from D6 until neutrophil count>1500/muL. The R-DA-EPOCH regimen was escalated from level -1 to level 1 in the subsequent cycles. The patient received six cycles of R-DA-EPOCH and two cycles of high dose Methotrexate (3 gr/m2), after the 5th and 6th cycle of R-DA-EPOCH. Three months after the completion of six cycles of immunochemotherapy, a marked decrease of lymphoma infiltration in the post-chemotherapy imaging was found (Fig. 1A,B,C). The Deauville score in PET-CT scan was 1. Left ventricular ejection fraction was increased at 64%. The treatment was complicated (D12) with reversible paralytic ileus, due to vincristine neurotoxicity (grade III), which was discontinued after the first cycle and with choledocholithiasis (D24) which was resolved with ERCP.

He denied tinnitus, hearing loss, headaches, and was found to be grossly neurologically intact. Magnetic resonance (MR) of the brain revealed a lesion demonstrating T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity with peripheral and septal enhancement in the right CPA [Figure 1]. Whether this lesion was intra-axial or extra-axial was not clear. After discussion with the patient regarding options for management, the decision was made to proceed with surgical resection.
The patient was booked for a retrosigmoid craniotomy for removal of the CPA tumor. A right frontal external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed at the beginning of the case. During craniotomy, retraction of the cerebellum revealed the tumor to be extra-axial [Figure 2]. The gross appearance of the tumor was suggestive of a highly vascular lesion, and so intraoperatively, a decision was made to attempt an en-bloc resection. The tumor was circumferentially dissected from the cranial nerve VII/VIII complex as well as from the choroid plexus at the foramen of Luschka. Following this, vascular feeders of the tumor were coagulated and the tumor was excised. Frozen sections returned consistent with low-grade tumor. Final pathology showed epithelioid foamy stromal cells with abundant thin-walled capillary-like vessels. The stromal cells were positive for inhibin, vimentin, and S-100. Reticulin and CD34 staining outlined the dense reticular capillary network of the tumor, but the typical dense pericellular network found in schwannoma was not present. No expression of epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) or progesterone receptor was observed. MIB1 index was <5%. The final diagnosis was reticular variant hemangioblastoma [Figure 3].

PMC4822807_01,PMC4822807,Female,14.0,"A 14-year-old African American female developed a painless iris mass in the right eye for 10 months. She had a vertically transmitted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection since birth. As a result of poor compliance, the most recent CD4 count was 27 cell/mm3 without previous opportunistic infections. HIV viral load was 60,261 copies/mL. The patient had been taking antiretroviral drugs (nevirapine, zidovudine, and lamivudine) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at the time of visit.
She complained of blurred vision in the right eye. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 OD and 20/25 OS. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy in the right eye revealed an oval, yellowish, highly vascularized iris mass with 6 mm horizontal diameter and 10 mm vertical diameter extending from the 4:00 to 11:00 positions (Figure 1). Multiple iris pigment epithelial cysts were found adhering to the posterior iris surface. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the left eye and dilated ophthalmoscopies of both eyes demonstrated no significant findings. Gonioscopy showed a tumor occupying the entire iris surface and obstructing the temporal anterior chamber angle. The anterior surface of the tumor adhered to the corneal endothelium. Ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed a hypoechoic mass coalesced with iris stroma and multiple underlying posterior iris pigment epithelial cysts (Figure 2). The largest diameter was 5.6 (horizontal) and 9.3 mm (vertical) by ultrasonic measurements. Since the tumor was confined within the iris tissue with ciliary body extension, an iridocyclectomy was performed to remove the entire mass. The neoplastic lesion that was removed was solid with homogeneous gray-white cut surfaces.
Histology revealed the specimen consisting of iris tissue with an attached tumor mass. The tumor lesion consisted of plump-shaped and epithelioid-appearing cells containing mildly pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli, and ill-defined eosinophilic cytoplasm. Vague fascicular arranging pattern was observed. Mitotic count was ~8/10 high-power fields (HPF). Tumor necrosis was not found. Because of its epithelioid shape, tumors with such morphology, eg, malignant melanoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, and EBV-SMT were included in the lists of differential diagnoses with immunohistochemical studies which were performed accordingly. The neoplastic cells were strongly reactive to smooth muscle actin but negative to cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), S-100, desmin, epithelial membrane antigen, and HMB-45. In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded ribonucleic acid revealed a positive reaction in most regions of the tumor (Figure 3). The final diagnosis was, therefore, concluded as ""EBV-associated SMT"".
At 14-month follow-up, the patient was free of disease. The visual acuity was 20/25 OD (Figure 4).

She complained of severe lingering pain to cold lasting for few minutes. She also complained of spontaneous pain during the day and at night time. Review of the patient's medical history revealed no significant findings.
Extraoral evaluation revealed normal soft tissue structures with no apparent pathosis. Intraoral examination showed a first left lower molar with a large carious lesion. Diagnostic tests were performed; the involved tooth responded with mild pain to percussion and severe lingering pain to Endo-Frost cold spray (Roeko; Coltene Whaledent, Langenau, Germany).
Radiographic examination showed a large carious lesion associated with apical periodontitis [Figure 1]. The adjacent/opposing teeth were asymptomatic and responded normally to all diagnostic tests. Based on the clinical and radiographic examinations, the diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis with apical periodontitis was made. Thereafter, IPT of the tooth was decided; an informed consent was obtained from the patient's legal guardian.
The patient was instructed to rinse her mouth with 0.2% chlorhexidine. The tooth was anesthetized with 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine (DarouPakhsh, Tehran, Iran) and then isolated with rubber dam. Subsequently the dentin-enamel junction was completely excavated. The bulk of soft carious dentin was carefully removed by tungsten-carbide round burs (Komet, Lemgo, Germany) at low speed; medium and large spoon excavators (Ash, London, UK) were also used. Excavation was terminated once the remaining carious dentin showed increased resistance to manual instrumentation. After that, the remaining carious dentin in pulpal floor was covered by  1.5 mm layer of CEM cement (BioniqueDent, Tehran, Iran). The remaining tooth cavity was then restored/sealed with glass-ionomer cement and composite resin sandwich technique [Figure 2].
The patient was re-examined clinically after 1 and 7 days. At the 1-day follow-up the patient complained of sensitivity to cold which had significantly decreased 1 week post-operatively. Tenderness to percussion was not reported in both follow-ups. Patient was recalled at 1 year for clinical/radiographic follow-up. Clinical examination with cold test showed a vital tooth which was functional, asymptomatic, with normal physiologic mobility, normal probing depths, and a satisfactory coronal restoration.

PMC3616025_01,PMC3616025,Female,19.0,"A 19-year-old woman presented to the outpatient clinic of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University, with a painless right breast mass of 5 months duration, which had progressively increased in size. Three months following appearance of the breast mass, the patient complained of pain related to the left knee, then appearance of a mass in the left knee. The patient denied any personal or family history of malignancy. Upon examination, there was a huge mass (10x12 cm), involving almost the whole of the right breast and invading the overlying skin, causing nipple ulceration. The mass was associated with bilateral axillary lymph nodes enlargement, hard and amalgamated on the ipsilateral side, while mobile and firm on the contralateral one (Figure 1). The clinical and radiological characteristics of the breast mass were highly suspicious of malignancy. Biopsy from the mass revealed invasive duct carcinoma grade II with scattered lympho-vascular permeation (Figure 2A,B). Immunostaining for estrogen and progesterone receptors were positive (ER+, PR +), and Her-2/neu was overexpressed (score 3). Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) revealed metastatic deposits in the ipsilateral and the contralateral axillary nodes.
Plain X-ray of the chest and liver ultrasonography were free of metastatic deposits, while bone scan showed a single area of increased uptake in the supracondylar region of the left femur, but the rest of the skeleton was free. Local X-ray of the left femur showed an irregular, dense, ill-defined, osteosclerotic lesion, with possible soft tissue extension (Figure 3), which was confirmed by MRI. Radiological features of the lesion raised the suspicion of second primary malignant lesion rather than breast cancer, so biopsy from the bone lesion was taken. Pathological examination showed a malignant neoplasm formed of proliferating pleomorphic large cells having scanty cytoplasm, and hyperchromatic nuclei with related deposition of thin lace-like branching osteoid matrix and negative immunostaining for CK (Figure 2C,D), excluding breast origin and confirming the diagnosis of conventional osteosarcoma GII, osteoblastic type. Hence, the final diagnosis was a case with double primary tumors: a) invasive duct carcinoma of the right breast, metastatic to contra-lateral axillary LNs (T4b N2a M1), and b) osteosarcoma of the LT femur (Enneking stage IIB). Chemotherapy treatment was started with 1 cycle of FEC 100 regimen (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin & 5-fluorouracil), which was associated with regression of the breast mass, but progression of the osteosarcoma. The patient was then shifted to another regimen, which has activity in both types of tumors (docetaxel 70 mg/m2 D1, Cisplatin 70 mg/m2 D1 & Epirubicin 80 mg/m2 D1), and she showed a good partial clinical response in both lesions.
Ten micron thick sections were obtained from paraffin blocks of both biopsies (breast invasive duct carcinoma & Lt femur osteosarcoma) and were subjected to genetic testing to search for mismatch repair (MMR) genes aberrations as a highly possible explanation for the multiple, early-onset neoplasms in the patient. DNA and RNA extraction was done using commercially available DNA& RNA extraction kits (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's protocols. Extracted DNA was used to detect: a) promoter hypermethylation (PM) in BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2 and GPB6, b) mutations and microsatellite instability (MSI) of MLH1 and MSH2 , c) mutations in exons 5-9 of the p53 and exons 6, 7, 11 of BRCA-1 genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/sequencing, d) loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in exons 6, 7,11 of BRCA-1, and e) mutations of K12/13-ras by PCR/RFLP. The RNA was used to detect BRCA1&2, ERCC1, RRM1, MSH2, MLH1 and MSH6 expression by quantitative real time PCR. Her2/neu gene amplification in breast and osteosarcoma was determined by chromogen in situ hybridization (CISH) with Invitrogen, Spot Light HER2 detection kit according to manufacturer's instructions.
Her2/neu gene amplification was detected in the breast tumor (BT) but not in the osteosarcoma (OS). P53 mutations were detected in BT and OS, though at different codons (Figure 4), while K13-ras mutations was detected in OS only (Figure 5). BRCA1 gene mutations were concentrated at exons 11 and 1, whereas LOH concentrated at exons 11 followed by 6 (Tables 1, 2). No mutations were detected in BRCA2 gene, though reduced mRNA expression of BRCA1&2 (Figure 6) was evident in both tumor samples. Similarly, ERCC1, MLH1, MSH2 mRNA expression was reduced in both tumors, especially in the OS, whereas MSH6 was normally expressed and RRM1 was overexpressed in both tumors. MLH1 and MSH2 showed PM in both tumors (Figure 7), MSI in BT, and different mutational events in both tumors (Tables 1, 2 & Figure 8).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3616025/,7,images/PMC3/PMC361/PMC3616025_01
PMC5779791_01,PMC5779791,Male,33.0,"A 33-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of insidious low back pain intermittently. Twenty days before admission to our hospital, his back pain was significantly aggravated, which caused him to have difficulty in walking and sleeping. He denied the history of systemic disease and trauma. Recently, the pain severely affected his life and work especially when movements. There was no history of exposure to TB, including his family. The patient had systemic TB symptoms and signs including night sweats and decreased appetite with weight loss and progressive low-grade fever. He admitted a history of smoking, alcohol consumption without drug abuse. Physical examination demonstrated there was no visible or palpable spinal deformity, but definite tenderness could be elicited over the spinous processes of the extensive lower thoracic vertebrae. Neurologic examination represented no specific findings including that his reflexes of knee and ankle were normal. Subsequently, muscle strength and tension of lower limbs were also normal, and the straight leg raise test was negative in bilateral lower limbs. No other positive findings were found on physical examination. Laboratory investigations revealed red blood cells count, hemoglobin level, and white blood cells count were all within a normal range in spite of high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 48 mm/hour), high C-reactive protein (66.9 mg/L). TB antibody and purified protein in derivate of tuberculin (PPD) test and human immune deficiency viral infection (HIV) were negative, but the TB spot (T-Spot) test was positive. Besides, the result of bone marrow puncture and serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) were all negative. Other laboratory tests were within reference range.
During the hospitalization, the patient underwent thorough radiographic examinations.
Routine image analysis demonstrated normal chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound evidenced normal findings. A thoracolumbar spine X-ray was unremarkable. Whereas further computed tomographic of whole spine images surprizing us, indicated multifocal diffuse lesions located in cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae showing multiple level worm-eaten and osteolytic bony destruction, including C5, T1-T5, T7-T12, L1-L5, and S1 (Fig. 1). At the bodies of C5, T1, T2, T4-T5 (spinous processes and adjacent ribs), T8-T11, L1-L5, and S1 vertebrae, osteolytic bone lesions were noted along with the similar lesions at the transverse process of T7 (neural arch), T11-T12 (spinous processes, neural arch, and adjacent ribs), L1, and L4. Intervertebral discs spared. There was a paravertebral mass at the T9-T10 level (Fig. 2). On whole spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, there were heterogeneous mixed high-intensity changes at C3, C5, T1-T5, T7-T12, L1-L5, and S1 segments on T2 weighted images and decreased signal intensity on T1 weighted images. Besides, the epidural abscess at the posterior of the spinal canal at T7 and T12 compressed the dural sac distinctly and a fusiform paraspinal abscess located at T9-T10 without obvious collapse of the adjacent vertebral body (Fig. 3).
According to the constitutional symptoms of TB and all imaging and laboratory findings of this patient in our department, we hold a multidisciplinary conference including oncologists, radiologists, and orthopedists. Eventually, differential diagnoses such as lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and metastatic disease were suspected. Considering the risk of spinal cord compression and pathologic fracture, which may cause progressive severe neurological symptoms and deformity, could happen at any time. An open biopsy rather than computed tomography (CT)-guided needle biopsy was conducted by our experienced surgeon at the T11 level to make a clear diagnosis. Intraoperatively, we located at the spinous process of T11, then resected the partial lesion of the right transverse process. The excised specimen resembled a kind of cheese with necrosis material.
Pathological examination indicated a chronic granulomatous inflammation with abundant caseous necrosis, considering tuberculous inflammation (Fig. 4). And, negative microscopy for acid-fast bacilli from the specimen. However, in some cases, it was difficult to distinguish the lesions caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis from other bacterial granulomas that may be still misdiagnosed. Meanwhile, we acquired the consent from the patient and his family to start on anti-TB trial chemotherapy, including rifampicin (450 mg/day), isoniazid (300 mg/day), ethambutol (750 mg/day), pyrazinamide (750 mg/day), and levofloxacin (500 mg/day), paying attention to nutrition supplement at the same time. The treatment turned out to be successful based on the lab test results, showing his ESR is reduced to 18 mm/hour, CRP to 11.3 mg/L, and significant improvement of systemic TB symptoms within 8 weeks of starting antitubercular trial therapy. Then the final diagnosis was an unusual presentation of skipped multifocal extensive spinal TB. As a consequence, we switched to a standard anti-TB chemotherapy without levofloxacin for a total duration of 12 months. Furthermore, the patient had achieved complete recovery without any complications. At 18-month follow-up, all the worm-eaten and osteolytic bony lesions were healed apparently, showing the disappearance of paravertebral and epidural abscess, and there was no evidence of recurrence on CT scan (Figs. 5 and 6).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5779791/,9,images/PMC5/PMC577/PMC5779791_01

Chest CT showed a pure GGO lesion measuring 8 mm in diameter in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe (Fig. 1). The patient had quit smoking approximately 15 years previously. He had regularly seen a family doctor for chronic gastritis. The laboratory workup, including tests for tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, and cytokeratin 19 fragment, did not show remarkable results. The lesion was suspected to be a slow-growing early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. For diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, a segmentectomy (anterior segment of the right upper lobe) was performed via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Pathologic examination showed thickening of the alveolar septum caused by the proliferation of capillary vessels without cytological atypia (Fig. 2A). Immunohistochemistry revealed that this lesion was negative for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1, Fig. 2B) and cytokeratin and positive for CD31 and CD34 (Fig. 2C and D).

He also gives history of weight loss, loss of appetite, low grade fever. He was non-smoker and non-alcoholic. He had no significant past history of pulmonary tuberculosis or any contact with patient of TB or neither had HIV infection. He was not screened for diabetes mellitus and hypertension. On examination he was afebrile, regular pulse at 84/min. His blood pressure was 120/70 mmhg. He was anicteric and there was no lymphadenopathy. On abdominal examination shifting dullness and fluid thrill suggestive of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity was present. Spleen was not palpable. Investigation revealed haemoglobin of 9 gram percent, fasting blood sugar was 98 mg/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 90 mm/1st hour. His tuberculin test was positive (18 mm). The HIV serologic test was negative. Other Blood biochemical profile like liver function test and kidney function test were within normal limits. The chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed ascites with multiple ill defined areas of hypoechogenesity in spleen. The axial contrast enhanced Computerised Tomography showed irregular hypo dense peripherally enhancing lesions in spleen, and fluid in anterior perihepatic space suggestive of splenic abscess [Figure 1]. There was no bowel thickening, no septa and no lymph node enlargement. The computed tomography (CT) guided fine needle aspiration biopsy from hypo echogenic area of spleen was performed. The cytomorphology showed granulomas with area of caseation in the centre surrounded by variable number of langhans giant cells and epitheloid cells favouring diagnosis of tuberculosis [Figure 2]. Culture and polymerase chain reaction based confirmation could not be contemplated due to inadequacy of sample. Ascitic fluid examination revealed total white cell count of 450 with lymphocyte 85%, protein 4.6 mg/dl, glucose 60 mg/dl, LDH 442 u/l, cholesterol 43 mg/dl. Serum ascitic albumin gradient was 0.8 suggestive of exudative fluid. Tuberculosis is one of the common causes of exudative fluid in this part of the world. Microscopy was requested for malignant cells and mycobacterium which was negative.

Her mother, younger sister and daughter also each had a history of breast cancer. At 60 years of age, the patient underwent sigmoidectomy and right colectomy with D3 lymph node dissection for both sigmoid colon cancer (fig. 1) and transverse colon cancer. During that operation, lavage of the remnant colon was performed before anastomosis, and automatic anastomotic devices were used. The pathological diagnoses revealed both sigmoid colon cancer and transverse colon cancer of T3N0M0, stage IIA. Both the oral and anal margins of the resected colon had a sufficient length: the transverse margin measured 135 mm (oral wedge) and 50 mm (anal wedge), while the sigmoid margin measured 40 mm (oral wedge) and 50 mm (anal wedge) (fig. 1a). At 3-year follow-up, colonoscopy and computed tomography revealed no signs of recurrence (fig. 2a). At 5-year follow-up, colonoscopy demonstrated surrounding flaring and swelling in the anastomotic area of the sigmoid colon (fig. 2b). A biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma. The levels of the tumor markers CEA and CA19-9 were both within the normal limits at that time. There were no signs of recurrence in other locations, such as the liver and lungs, or other areas of the remnant colon. Therefore, under a diagnosis of anastomotic recurrence over 5 years after surgery, we performed lower anterior resection. The tumor measured 45 x 35 mm and was located at the previous anastomotic site (fig. 3a). Pathology revealed histological features that resembled the pattern of the previous tumor, and there were masses of cancerous cells in the subserosal and muscular layers near the fissured muscular layer, which comprised the anastomotic area (fig. 3b). In addition, in the mucous membranes surrounding the anastomotic area, there was hyperplasia of cancerous cells that pushed up layers from deeper mucous membranes. Furthermore, there were no cancerous cells in the mucous membranes, which indicated that the cells were derived from the primary lesion (fig. 3b). Based on these observations, the final diagnosis was anastomotic recurrence of sigmoid colon cancer after surgery. No lymph node metastasis was observed among the 18 dissected lymph nodes. There have been no signs of recurrence for the 2 years since the last surgery.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3884191/,6,images/PMC3/PMC388/PMC3884191_01
PMC4532018_01,PMC4532018,Male,36.0,"A 36-year-old man was admitted to Yong Dong Severance Hospital because of a 10-day history of jaundice and epigastric discomfort. He had suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis about 15 years and 6 years before. On admission, he had pruritus, icteric sclerae and skin. The breathing sound was decreased on the right lower lung field. Direct tenderness was noted on the epigastrium, but liver and spleen were not palpable.
Abnormal laboratory findings were as follows: platelets 101,000/mm3, total bilirubin 19.6 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 13.4 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 188 IU/L, gamma-GTP 133 IU/L, alpha-fetoprotein 22.1 ng/ml, urine bilirubin  , urobilinogen +/-. Serum HBsAg, anti-HBc Ab and anti-HBeAb were positive.
An ultrasound examination disclosed a mass at the hepatic hilus, dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct and cirrhotic change of the liver. A dynamic abdominal CT scan showed an enhancing mass at the hepatic hilus, liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly without focal lesion in hepatic parenchyma (Fig. 1). An endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) revealed a 3x2 cm sized oval shaped filling defect at the upper common hepatic duct, including the porta hepatis. The surface of the mass was smooth and the upstream intrahepatic bile ducts were slightly dilated (Fig. 2A). An endoscopic nasobiliary drainage was attempted, but failed because a hydrophilic guidewire could not be passed over the obstructing mass. On a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) (Fig. 2B), through a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) tube, dye was well passed over the obstructing mass. The mass seemed slightly lobulated and the surface was shallowly grooved. A sono-guided fine needle aspiration cytology revealed no malignant cells. On the 24th hospital day, hepatic angiography was performed and did not show any tumor staining.
On the 28th hospital day, an explorative laparotomy was performed. Grossly, the liver showed macronodular cirrhosis without any palpable masses. An irregular shaped soft tissue mass admixed with bile was found at the hepatic hilus after the distended commom hepatic duct was opened. The mass was yellowish to grayish in color and very friable. These findings were consistent with a so-called ""chicken fat"" appearance. Cholecystectomy, segmental resection of the intrahepatic ducts and common hepatic duct, septoplasty of the intrahepatic duct and hepaticojejunostomy were performed.
Microscopically, tumor cells appeared as nests in pseudoacinus patterns, and bile pigment was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A, 3B, 3C). The immunohistochemical stain demonstrated positive reaction for alpha-fetoprotein but negative reaction for carinoembryonic antigen (Fig. 4A, 4B). The final diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma.
The patient was recommended to have adjuvant therapy such as external radiotherapy or systemic chemotherapy, but refused. Three months after the operation, a hepatic angiography with CT arterioportography and lipiodol-CT were performed, which gave no definite mass lesion in the hepatic parenchyma. About 6 months after the operation, a follow-up ultrasound examination disclosed two small hypoechoic lesions (1.2-1.5 cm in diameter) at the segment 8 and the segment 5 (Fig. 5A, 5B). A repeat hepatic angiography with CT arterioportography was performed. Tumor staining was not found on hepatic angiography, but two low density lesions were suspected at the segment 8 and the segment 5 on CT arterioportography (Fig. 6A, 6B). However, no lipiodol remained on lipiodol-CT taken 3 weeks later (Fig. 7A, 7B). The patient has been closely followed up with ultrasonography every 2 months until now (1 year after the operation) and there was no evidence of the growth of two hypoechoic lesions seen on ultrasonography or development of new lesions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4532018/,12,images/PMC4/PMC453/PMC4532018_01

The lesion was asymptomatic and clinical examination revealed facial asymmetry. Intraorally, expansion of the vestibular and palatine cortical bone of the maxilla were observed, covered with normal oral mucosa and without any signs of inflammation. Radiographically a unilocular and well-delimitated radiolucency, in the right side of the maxilla was noted, with 8 months of evolution. Furthermore, displacement of the second maxillary right molar and root resorption of the teeth (second and third molars) involved were observed, as well as the absence of the first molar (Fig. 1). Cone-beam computed tomography revealed a hypodense lesion in relation to the maxillary sinus, from tooth 14-18 (Figs. 2 and 3 A). Axial and coronal views showed erosion of the vestibular and palatine sinus walls (Fig. 2). Root resorption of tooth 17 and 18 could be noted in the parasagittal view in the tomograph (Fig. 3B and C). Some radiopacities observed inside the lesion were suggestive of calcification or dental fragments (Fig. 3D and E). Fine needle aspiration (5 mL) of a citrine liquid and an incisional biopsy were performed. The clinical hypothesis was of odontogenic tumor or fibro-osseous lesion. Microscopic analysis showed a cystic cavity lined by a thin odontogenic epithelium forming cords or islands and with basal cells arranged in palisade, with vacuolated cytoplasm, while central cells resembled stellate reticulum (Fig. 4A and B). In some areas, the odontogenic epithelium was organized with duct-like structures containing an eosinophilic and amorphous material. Some foci of mineralized dentin characterized by a tubular formation and globular calcification Fig. 4C-F) interlaced with osteodentin containing cells, were detected (Fig. 4G and H). The enamel matrix, predentin and ectomesenchyme were not evident in this tumor. According to the clinical, radiographic and microscopic features, the final diagnosis was of an adenomatoid odontogenic tumor associated with odontoma.

PMC6246109_01,PMC6246109,Male,25.0,"A 25-year-old man with extreme obesity reported a 1-year history of cough and was treated for asthma without relief of his symptoms. He subsequently developed hemoptysis prompting computed tomography that revealed a 3.6 x 3.9 x 4.9 cm mass within the wall of the trachea that caused critical narrowing of the trachea ( Fig. 1 ). 
The patient was found to be in near extremis with inspiratory stridor and was taken to the operating room urgently to secure the airway with bronchoscopic debridement. Awake anesthesia was performed, and a flexible bronchoscope was used to pass a 5-0 endotracheal tube distal to the tumor. The right internal jugular vein was then percutaneously cannulated with a 31-Fr Avalon Elite catheter (Maquet, Wayne, New Jersey, United States) under fluoroscopic and echocardiographic guidance and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was then initiated. The tumor was biopsied via rigid bronchoscopy and thereafter bled extensively. Despite application of neosynephrine and argon coagulation, bleeding only ceased following passage of an 8-0 endotracheal tube distal to the tumor.
 Further attempt at bronchoscopic debridement was aborted, and the patient was decannulated and returned to the intensive care unit intubated. On review of the pathology ( Fig. 2 ), the tumor was composed of nests of monotonous round cells and thin-walled vessels containing focally infiltrating smooth muscle. Immunohistochemistry stains were positive for smooth muscle actin and negative for chromogranin. While rare, these findings suggested tracheal glomus tumor. 
 The patient was then brought back to the operating room for definitive resection. Repeat flexible bronchoscopy revealed that the tracheal tumor was located approximately 4 cm distal to the larynx and extended to 4 cm proximal to the carina. A collar incision with an upper partial median sternotomy was performed to expose the tumor fully. The tumor was found to involve the right tracheal wall with extraluminal extension, but without invasion of the surrounding structures. The trachea was circumferentially dissected, and the tumor was excised ( Fig. 3 ) with the use of cross-table ventilation and an armored endotracheal tube. The trachea was reconstructed end-to-end without the need for releasing maneuvers or endoscopic stenting. The left sternohyoid muscle was mobilized and placed between the tracheal anastomosis and the innominate artery. The patient was then extubated and returned to the intensive care unit. 
Postoperatively, the patient developed pneumonia that required bronchoscopy, and the hospital course was otherwise unremarkable. In review at our multidisciplinary tumor board, the final diagnosis was glomus tumor of uncertain malignant potential given the deep location and size greater than 2 cm.

PMC7841290_01,PMC7841290,Male,48.0,"A 48-year-old man who initially presented with seizures was subsequently diagnosed with AO, WHO grade III nineteen years prior to this study. As illustrated in Figure 1A, he received radiation therapy (RT) after the initial surgery to remove the tumor. Eight years later, he had a second resection followed by two years of temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. The patient then received five cycles of procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine (PCV) treatment due to the concern of disease progression. Four years prior to the current presentation, he underwent a third surgical resection after disease progression and was treated with bevacizumab for a year until the disease was found to recur. The patient underwent a fourth resection two years prior to presentation to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for further evaluation. He was enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT03718767) and started nivolumab treatment. An MRI scan after two cycles of treatment (nivolumab 240 mg intravenously, every two weeks on a 28 day-cycle) showed that the enhancing lesions in the right insular region increased in size significantly, while the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal in the right frontal and temporal lobe remained largely unchanged from the baseline, suggesting worsening high grade glioma. (Figure 1B). A surgical debulking was indicated due to potentially life-threatening mass effect and a craniotomy with tumor resection was performed. The pathologic exam showed a mixture of tumor cells and immune cell infiltration which suggested treatment effects (Figure 1C). The final diagnosis was recurrent AO. Post-surgically, the patient's overall condition became worse but without focal neurological deficit. The patient was recommended comfort care with a short course of palliative radiation to the tumor resection bed.
A hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tumor slide showed a neoplastic process with oligodendroglia phenotype including cells with round nuclei. High grade features including marked cellularity, cell atypia, mitoses, vascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis were present. Additional immunohistochemistry (IHC) exam of immune cells revealed the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration. CD68+ cells, representing macrophage and microglia cell populations, were also identified on the tumor slides (Figure 1C).
To better understand the tumor microenvironment, particularly the immune cell distribution in radiographically different areas following immunotherapy, the samples were collected from both enhancing and non-enhancing lesions during the tumor resection (lower left, Figure 1B), and processed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis.
We identified ten major cell types based on their gene expression profiles (Figure 2A). Though the tissues were expected to be composed of mostly tumor, only 3.5% of the cells were classified as oligodendroglioma cells (Figure 2B). Most of the cell clusters were identified as immune cell types, including microglia (34.2%), macrophages/monocytes (14.4%), NK cells (9.8%), T cells (24.6%), and a small amount of B cells (0.9%) (Figure 2B). Other non-tumor cells included endothelial cells (4%), chondrocytes (2.8%), tissue stem cells (2.7%), and neurons (3.1%). Thus, based on the single-cell analysis, almost 84% of the cells analyzed were immune cells and less than 5% of oligodendroglioma cells. The low percentage of tumor cells in the single-cell population determined by the scRNAseq seems to be lower than that detected by the H&E staining on tumor tissue slides. This difference may be due to tissue sampling or single-cell processing, including dead cell removal. Here, we focused on the immune microenvironment.
Notably, cell type distribution was quite different in enhancing versus non-enhancing lesions. Over half (51.5%) of the cells in non-enhancing lesion were composed of microglia compared to only 10.4% of the cells in enhancing tissue (Figure 2C). There was a slightly higher percentage of macrophages/monocytes in the enhancing sample (17.6%) compared with non-enhancing sample (12.1%). Interestingly, 43.6% of the cells from enhancing lesion were composed of T cells compared to 10.9% of the cells from non-enhancing region. The percentages of NK cells within each sample were similar.
Since T cells, NK cells, microglia, and macrophages/monocytes were the most represented immune cell types in the tumor tissue, we further examined the relevant functions of these immune cells. Sub-clustering analysis of the T cells identified CD8+, CD4+, and regulatory T cell (Treg, CD4+/FOXP3+) subpopulations (Figure 3A). The CD8+ T cells, as expected, expressed the highest cytolytic score of T cells while the Tregs expressing at the lowest cytolytic score (Figure 3B). Interestingly there were many more T cells in the enhancing region (Figure 2A). When the cytolytic score per cell was calculated, a fold-change of 1.33 in non-enhancing lesion versus enhancing lesion was found (Wilcoxon test p = 3.084 x 10-6) (Figure 3C). Although we discovered that T cells in non-enhancing lesion expressed higher levels of PRF1, GZMM, GZMH, and GZMB when compared to that in the enhancing lesion, the significance of this is unknown and more studies are needed to define this in the context of immune therapy (Figure S1). Like CD8+ T cells, NK cells in the non-enhancing region expressed a higher cytolytic score compared to that of enhancing region (Figure 3C, fold change 1.52; Wilcoxon test, p = 4.136 x 10-14), though the percentages of NK cells within each sample were similar. By analyzing differential gene expression (DGE), we found that SH2D2A, encoding T cell Specific Adapter protein (TSAd), which mediates the activation of T cells, increased in the T cells of non-enhancing lesion (Figure S2). GNLY, which encodes granulysin, a protein presents in the cytotoxic granules that are released by the activated CTLs, was found to be upregulated in T cells from non-enhancing tumor area (Figure S2). NFKB1, which regulates the maturation and effector function of NK cells, was the only gene upregulated in NK cells of the enhancing lesion (Figure S3). These findings may not be applicable to all glioma cases. However, the DGE analysis at the single-cell level may help to explain the role of T/NK cells in the immune tumor microenvironment.
The majority of the microglia were found in the non-enhancing lesion, while macrophages/monocytes have a similar distribution in both enhancing and non-enhancing lesion (Figure 4A). As expected, both cell clusters expressed CD68, consistent with the identity of the cell types (Figures 4B). We used the markers of CD80, CD86, CD163, and MRC1 (CD206) to further characterize the functional status of the subpopulations. The expression of the M1-like (pro-inflammatory) cell marker CD80 was minimal throughout, while the CD86+ cells were much more enriched in both non-enhancing and enhancing lesions (Figure 4C). The expression of CD86 was found in both microglia and macrophages/monocytes. The expression of M2-like (anti-inflammatory) markers was found more in macrophages/monocytes but marginally in microglia population, suggesting that microglia may have more proinflammatory phenotype than the macrophages/monocytes in this case. Both M1-like and M2-like markers were found to be expressed in macrophages/monocytes to a similar extent in the enhancing and non-enhancing regions (Figure 4D). The DGE analysis revealed that RNASET2, which mediates the M1-like polarization and suppresses M2-like polarization, was upregulated in microglia and macrophages/monocytes of the non-enhancing lesion (Figure S2). This finding suggests a potential role of RNASET2 in an antitumor microenvironment after immune therapy. Together, the scRNAseq data indicate that the tumor microenvironment in this case is enriched with pro-inflammatory/anti-tumoral microglia after anti-PD-1 treatment.
Overall, the results demonstrate the presence of proinflammatory microglia, macrophages/monocytes and CD8+ T cells with high cytolytic scores in the tumor microenvironment after a short course of anti-PD-1 therapy, suggesting an immune response. Encouraged by the evidence of the immune response, the patient was continued on immunotherapy rather than hospice care. After a short course of palliative radiation around the resection cavity, he went on protocol ""Care of the Adult Oncology Patient, NCI"" (NCT00923065) to receive ipilimumab and nivolumab. Ipilimumab was administered at 1mg/kg every four weeks in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every two weeks for four cycles followed by nivolumab alone at 480 mg every four weeks for twelve cycles (each cycle is four weeks). Since the most recent surgery, he has remained radiographically and clinically stable for at least 12 months (Figure S4). Thus, the results of the scRNAseq analysis are supported by the prolonged durable response to immunotherapy in this patient.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7841290/,6,images/PMC7/PMC784/PMC7841290_01
PMC6610690_01,PMC6610690,Male,63.0,"The patient was a 63-year-old male smoker (40 pack-years). He presented with symptoms of cough, hemoptysis, fever, and weight loss for 2 months. The patient was admitted to the local hospital in 2016-03-21. The chest CT scan showed a soft tissue shadow of 2.8*3.5 cm with large patchy shadows around the upper lobe of the right lung (Fig. 1 A). A PET-CT scan revealed a mass of 2.5*3.5 cm near the right hilar and a patchy shadow of 4.9*3.3 cm in the upper lobe of the right lung. The mean FDG metabolism of the mass near the right hilar was 4.9 (the highest was 9.6). The mean FDG metabolism of the patchy shadow was 4.7 (the highest was 6.0). The CT scan-guided percutaneous biopsy in the right pulmonary apex and right upper lobe (area indicated by the white arrow in Fig. 1 A) was performed twice in 2016-03-25 and 2016-03-30, and pathology results showed chronic pneumonia and OP with local necrosis. The TBLB pathobiology in 2016-04-05 showed chronic inflammation of some bronchial mucosa in the right upper lobe. Community-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed. Cefotiam and Clindamycin were given as anti-infection therapies, and his body temperature dropped to normal, but cough and bloody sputum had not been well improved. A chest CT scan in 2016-04-11 showed that lesions in the upper lobe of the right lung had shrunk, but other lesions enlarged, and the lymph nodes in the right hilum and mediastinum were still swollen (Fig. 1 B).
The patient was admitted to Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University in 2016-05-10 for further diagnosis and treatment. Physical examination showed that he was well developed and nourished. The sounds in both lungs are clear and regular, with no abnormal changes in the heart or abdomen. Bilateral supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes were not enlarged. Blood routine and blood biochemistry showed the following: white cell count 10.81*109/l with 65.6% granulocytes and 16.4% lymphocytes, hemoglobin 119 g/l, platelet count 246*109/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 73 mm/H and C reactive protein 52.2 mg/l. T-spot test: antigen-A 1, antigen-B 0. Arterial blood gas analysis showed PO2 69.0 mmHg and PCO2 40 mmHg. Tumor marker: CA125 68.3 U/ml and Cyfra211 3.7 ng/ml were slightly elevated, and other markers, such as CEA, CA199, NSE, SCC and proGRP, were all normal. Antinuclear antibody (cytoplasmic pattern) 1:100 and other autoantibody or rheumatoid factors were all negative. The pathological sections from the local hospital were rechecked by our pathology department, considering OP with eosinophil infiltration and scattered hemosiderin deposition (Fig. 2 A).
Initial diagnosis of OP was made, and intravenous corticosteroid therapy was started for 2 weeks. Most symptoms disappeared, except for occasional hemoptysis. However, the follow-up chest CT scan in 2016-05-18 showed that lesions in the puncture site of the right lung were significantly reduced, but other lesions expanded, and the lymph nodes remained swollen (Fig. 1 C, D). We persuaded the patient to receive EBUS in 2016-05-20, and the examination showed slightly swollen mucosa and narrow lumen in the right upper bronchial. The lower segment of the right middle bronchial was external compressive stenosis with congestive mucosa. TBLB was performed under the guidance of ultrasound in the shadow of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, and pathobiology showed alveolar septal fibrous tissue hyperplasia, with organizing pneumonia lesions in some areas (Fig. 2 B). TBNA from 4R mediastinal lymph nodes showed atypical cells (Fig. 2 C). The immunohistochemical results were CD1a(-), CD21(-), CD23(-), CD30(-), CD33(-), CD68(+), CKpan(++), D2-40(-), EMA(+++), Langerin(-), S-100(+), Vim(+++), CD10(+), CD15(+), CD79a(+), ALK-1(-), PAX-5(-), P63(-), SPA(-), NapsinA(+), TTF-1(+), suggesting poorly differentiated carcinoma (sarcomatoid carcinoma is more likely) which arose from the alveolar epithelium. Bronchial aspiration cultures were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi. The final diagnosis was lung cancer and secondary organizing pneumonia. The patient received one cycle of chemotherapy (gemcitabine 2.0 d1, cisplatin 120 mg d1) and then lost follow-up.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6610690/,3,images/PMC6/PMC661/PMC6610690_01
PMC9058064_01,PMC9058064,Female,37.0,"A 37-year-old female was admitted to our hospital for palpable masses in the lower abdominal wall for 2 years. The masses had grown rapidly in recent half-year, and the bigger was about 3 cm in diameter.
The patient had touched the active masses located in the lower end of the incision on the lower abdominal wall, with a diameter of about 1 cm and no tenderness since 2 years ago. The masses consciously increased before the menstrual period and narrowed after the menstrual period. The patient felt the masses had grown rapidly in recent half a year and the bigger was about 3 cm in diameter. She had a regular menstrual cycle and no previous history of oral contraceptives and other hormone drugs, without abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, frequent urination, anal distension or other discomfort.
The patient had a history of laparotomy and myomectomy about 10 years ago, without the use of a power morcellator. It was finally confirmed as uterine myoma, about 8 cm in diameter in the posterior wall of uterine. The histopathology showed the myoma was in rich cell type, with red degeneration. In 2013, the patient underwent one cesarean section in an external hospital and abdominal wall foreign body resection was performed simultaneously. The postoperative pathological was reported multiple leiomyoma with active cell proliferation (under the skin of pubic caruncle, upper segment of the rectus abdominis, and peritoneal incision).
The patient denied the history of diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. Her personal and family history were unremarkable.
The ultrasonography showed a 1.5 cm x 1.8 cm x 1.5 cm hypoechoic mass in the posterior wall of the uterus and a 3.8 cm x 2.5 cm x 1.8 cm irregular mass behind the uterus. Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) showed a strip-like blood flow signal. In the subcutaneously muscular layer of the lower abdominal wall incision, there also were multiple solid masses with blood flow signal showed (Figures 1A-C). For further diagnosis, the pelvic enhanced MRI was performed, which showed surgical scar shadow in the anterior and lower abdominal wall. T1 and T2 low signal nodules could be seen in the soft tissue around the scar, in the right iliac fossa and behind the uterus. The larger one was located in the soft tissue of the abdominal wall, with a size of 2.6 cm x 1.7 cm x 2.8 cm. The enhanced scan was significantly enhanced but uniform. The size of uterus was normal without abnormal signal shadow found, and the enhancement was uniform (Figures 2A,B). A contrast-computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest also was performed. The texture of both lungs was clear, and the permeability of lung field was good. There was no enlarged lymph node shadow in mediastinum, and there was no abnormality in bilateral pleura and thorax.
Laboratory examinations for CA125, CEA, CA724, HE4, CA199 showed no deviation from normal values. Other blood test results were all in the normal spectrums.
The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy. We noted multiple solid nodules scattered located in the fat layer, fascial layer, intramuscular tissue, and peritoneal layer along the incision, varying in size from 0.5 to 4 cm. After entering into the abdominal cavity, there were extensive pelvic adhesion and multiple nodules found on the edge of greater omentum (3 cm in size), in the posterior wall of the uterus (3 cm in size), and in the uterorectal fossa (4 cm in size) close to rectum. Others were found in the left-posterior wall of uterine (2 cm in size), and on the surface of the right sacral ligament (2 cm in size), which were close to the ureter and surrounding tissue (Figures 3A,B). The activity of the uterus was poor, but both adnexa were normal. The intraoperative frozen section reported the nodules as leiomyoma. Finally, all the visible lesions and partial greater omentum were removed. Accurate hemostasis was performed and no drainage tube was placed to prevent further spread of neoplastic cells to the peritoneal cavity. The patient was given 6 cycles (per 28 days) of gonadotropin releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) to avoid a recurrence. Clinical and radiological follow-ups were strongly recommended for the patient.
The macroscopic tissue showed multiple solid nodules (Figures 4A,B). In microscopic observation, the nodules consisted of arranged spindle cells, with occasional mitotic figures and mild atypia, but no necrosis. Immunohistochemistry showed that SMA(+), Desmin(+), myogenin(-), Ki-67(+2%), HMB-45(-), CD34 (blood S-100) (-), CD117 (-), dog1(-), ER(-), PR(+) (Figures 5A,B).
The final diagnosis was a BML of abdominal wall and pelvic cavity, in rich cell type.
The patient supported and cooperated with our treatment very much. Up to now, there is no sign of recurrence or new lesions found by imaging examinations. The patient has no conscious discomfort, and feels so grateful for our operation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9058064/,11,images/PMC9/PMC905/PMC9058064_01
PMC4927557_01,PMC4927557,Female,49.0,"A 49-year-old woman visited our institute for an incidentally detected brain tumor during the routine medical checkup of the brain with MRI. She had a history of hysterectomy for uterine myoma 6 years ago and total thyroidectomy for thyroid carcinoma that was diagnosed as well-differentiated PTC 2 years ago. TNM-stage was Stage III (T3N0M0) when thyroidectomy. Radioiodine treatment was not performed because of no evidence of invasion to surrounding tissue, lymph node metastasis and distal metastasis. She also had a familial history of thyroid carcinoma, since her mother had suffered from the same thyroid tumor. Physical and neurological examinations were all normal with no deficit. All serum tumor markers were within the normal range. Computed tomography showed that the tumor was a homogeneously enhanced mass lesion in the left cerebellum. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a homogeneous strongly enhanced hypervascular lesion with surrounding enhanced vessels located in the left cerebellar hemisphere (Fig. 1a, b). Digital subtraction angiography showed a strongly stained lesion fed by the peripheral branch (tonsillohemispheric segment) of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and draining into the inferior vermian vein, revealing arteriovenous shunting (Fig. 1c-f). Preoperative thyroglobulin (Tg) was 9.5 ng/ml (normal range: 0-50), and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (Anti-Tg antibody) measured by FEIA method was under 6.0 IU/ml (normal range: under 13.6). A pre-diagnosis of solid type cerebellar hemangioblastoma was made based on these radiographic findings and the epidemiology that it is the most common primary cerebellar neoplasm in adults (Committee of Brain Tumor Registry of Japan).
We performed tumor resection by bilateral suboccipital approach. By opening the arachnoid membrane between the vermis and left biventral lobule, a long perspective from the proximal to distal portion of the PICA across the predicted location of the tumor bulk was exposed. The tumor position was identified using a navigation system, and the exposed well-margined tumor bulk was totally resected after dissecting the feeding artery from the PICA peripheral branch and the draining vein into the left inferior vermian vein. An intraoperative pathological examination was performed, and the frozen section of the tumor tissue showed that polygonal cells proliferated in nests and cords with many blood vessels (Fig. 2a). The findings appeared compatible with hemangioblastoma. Postoperatively, the patient had no physical or neurological symptoms.
Histological examination of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue revealed proliferation of vacuolated sheeted tumor cells with clear and eosinophilic cytoplasm and numerous thin-walled vessels (Fig. 2b, c). A thyroid follicle-like pattern including eosinophilic liquid was partially present (Fig. 2d). Irregular nuclear contours and nuclear grooves were focally observed. Immunohistochemical findings were positive for CD31 (dilution 1:40; Dako, Japan), CD34 (dilution 1:50; Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan), vimentin (dilution 1:50; Dako) and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) (dilution 1:200; Dako) (Fig. 2e-h), and negative for GFAP (data not shown). The final diagnosis was PTC.
Postoperative MRI showed total resection of the tumor bulk and no ischemic complications (Fig. 3). Therefore, postoperative radiotherapy and adjuvant therapy were not administered. At 2 years postoperatively, the patient has no symptoms and no recurrence on follow-up MRI. Tg and anti-Tg antibody 2 months and 2 years after operation were under 0.1 ng/ml and under 6.0 IU/ml, 0.11 ng/ml and under 6.0 IU/ml, respectively, which all were normal range.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4927557/,6,images/PMC4/PMC492/PMC4927557_01

He had a history of hypertension for many years, uncomplicated and treated with losartan/thiazide 50/12.5 mg and amlodipine 10 mg once daily. Nine years earlier, he was diagnosed with a transitiocellular, papillary bladder tumour, grade III with invasion; underwent successful endoscopic resection without need for oncological treatment; and was followed with annual cystoscopy. Three years later, he was surgically treated for a relapse of transitiocellular, papillary bladder tumour (grade I) and was followed for an additional 5 years without signs of recurrent disease at annual cystoscopy.
He was a retired industrial worker but with no known occupational exposure to asbestosis, silica, or dust. He was living with his spouse and had no hobbies resulting in exposure to hazardous fumes or dusts.
He was referred to an outpatient colonoscopy (17 months after he ended urological control visits), revealing an obstructing lower rectal mass. Only a paediatric coloscope could pass the lesion, and biopsies revealed adenocarcinoma, immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses positive for CK7 and TTF-1 (Fig. 1), and negative for GATA, CK20, CDX2, PLAP, CD117, PSA, and S100P. PCR showed wild-type EGFR status. Direct histological comparison showed no resemblance with his urological cancer.
Thoracoabdominal contrast-enhanced PET-CT scan showed multiple, PET-positive, enlarged mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, a right-sided pleural effusion and associated ipsilateral compression lower lobe atelectasis, ascites, and a tumour located in the rectum with invasion to levator muscles and vesicula seminalis (Figs. 2 and 3). Cytological sampling from mediastinal lymph nodes and pleural exudate showed identical adenocarcinoma including IHC profile cells with a high proliferation index assessed by Ki-67. A bronchoscopy showed no visual tumour.
At a multidisciplinary team conference, it was decided that the final diagnosis was primary lung cancer, stage TxN3M1b with local metastases to mediastinal lymph nodes, pleura, rectum, and peritoneum. The IHC results were considered to rule out primary colorectal cancer or vesical cancer with thoracic dissemination.
He started palliative carboplatin/vinorelbine and avastin (43 days after referral to gastroenterologist) as 4 series with 3 weeks intervals. Three-month PET-CT showed a mixed response with an overall sign of progression, and second-line chemotherapy was planned.

PMC4573862_01,PMC4573862,Female,47.0,"A 47-year-old African American female with a BMI of 40 presented to the emergency department with a 10 day history of abnormal vaginal bleeding. She had a history of thrombocytopenia 26 days earlier attributed to NSAID use and history of a similar episode one year earlier attributed to uterine fibroids that were planned for surgical treatment, but the patient was lost to follow-up. Past medical history consisted of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, thalassemia, fibromyalgia, migraine headaches, and back pain. Reproductive history consisted of menarche at age 13, one full-term pregnancy at age 42 and one abortion. Family history was doubtful for cervical or breast cancer. Medication history included 2 weeks of ibuprofen use for back pain prior to presentation. Social history was positive for occasional use of alcohol and marijuana. The patient had a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy performed after a prior evaluation for thrombocytopenia, the results of which were pending at time of presentation. A mammogram performed one year earlier was negative.
On examination, vital signs revealed tachycardia (102 beats/min) and were otherwise normal. Physical examination revealed pale conjunctiva, skin pallor, suprapubic tenderness, and tenderness surrounding the vagina with moderate dark red vaginal bleeding. With the past history of bleeding uterine fibroids, this was provisionally suspected to be the cause of re-bleeding and breast examination was missed being done at this point. Laboratory values revealed low hemoglobin (7.2 g/dL), low platelet count (20,000/mm3), and an elevated white blood cell count (13,800 mm3) with a left shift including metamyelocytes and bandemia. Chemistry panel revealed an elevated total calcium (11.6 mg/dL) and was otherwise normal. Urinalysis revealed white blood cells (15-25/HPF) and red blood cells (15-25/HPF) as well as few bacteria. Pelvic ultrasound revealed multiple uterine fibroids, with the largest measuring 3.7 cm, and an irregular endometrium measuring 13 mm in thickness. The patient was admitted for symptomatic anemia, red blood cell and platelet transfusions, and obstetrical and gynecological consultation.
Breast examination was performed and revealed edema and induration of the lower half of the right breast and was unremarkable in the left breast. Shortly after admission, the results of her bone marrow biopsy were retrieved and revealed a hypercellular bone marrow with marked diffuse fibrosis and extensive involvement by metastatic carcinoma of the breast. Mammography was performed and revealed no concerning findings in the left breast and multi-centric lesions in the right breast with non-muscle like abnormal enhancements in the upper and lower right quadrants suspicious for malignancy (BI-RADS 4A). Bilateral axillary lymph nodes were detected in the infra-pectoral and retro-pectoral regions. CT of the chest was performed and revealed skin thickening of the right breast, bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy with the largest measuring 1.8 cm x 1.3 cm, diffuse heterogenous sclerotic changes involving the sternum, thoracic vertebrae, multiple ribs, bilateral scapula, and mild free fluid in the upper abdomen. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed and revealed prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes and diffuse lytic lesions with heterogeneous bone marrow in the lumbar spine. MRI of lumbar spine revealed metastatic disease of lumbar spine, sacrum, and iliac bones. Bone scan was performed and revealed no evidence of bone metastasis. Biopsy of the right breast revealed a Grade 2 invasive lobular carcinoma in multiple cores, with a maximum single core linear length of 1.8 cm (Figs. 1 and 2). Endocrine receptor assays revealed the tumor to be ER positive (50%) and PR positive (70%). The malignancy was further found to be HER2/neu negative. Additionally, the patient underwent dilatation and curettage of the uterus with microscopic examination of endometrial curettings that revealed cells consistent with lobular carcinoma of the breast that were positive for AE1/3 and GATA-3 (Figs. 3-6). Her final diagnosis prior to discharge described a right breast invasive lobular carcinoma with metastasis to the bone marrow and endometrium (stage 4). She was discharged to follow-up with the oncology service and consideration of chemotherapy and hormonal management.
Nineteen days after discharge, the patient presented again to the emergency department with complaints of repeated vomiting of clear liquid, abdominal pain, and diarrhea for one week. On examination the patient was anicteric and in moderate distress. Vital signs revealed tachycardia (130 beats/min) and were otherwise normal. Physical examination of the abdomen revealed right upper quadrant tenderness and mild right lower quadrant tenderness without rebound and was otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated white blood cell count (11,700/mm3), low hemoglobin (7.5 g/dL), low platelet count (12,000/mm3), elevated ALT (172 IU/L), elevated AST (168 IU/L), mildly elevated direct bilirubin (0.4 mg/dL), and elevated alkaline phosphatase (224 IU/L). Plain abdominal X-rays were performed and were unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a contracted gallbladder with a large gallstone impacted within the gallbladder, a thickened wall and pericholecystic fluid consistent with acute cholecystitis. There was a positive sonographic Murphy's sign. The gallbladder wall thickness was 2.7 mm and there was no dilatation of the extrahepatic bile ducts. She was admitted for red blood cell and platelet transfusions, intravenous antibiotics, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.
Post-admission, the patient continued to complain of moderate abdominal pain and vomiting that were managed medically, and received multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells and platelets until deemed fit for surgery. ERCP was not performed due to patient refusal. On post-admission day 4, she underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Immediately preoperatively, the white blood count was 14,200/mm3, hemoglobin was 9.0 g/dL, and platelets were 91,000/mm3. Intra-operatively, there was moderate hemorrhagic peritoneal fluid upon entry into the peritoneal cavity. The gallbladder was found to be fibrotic and contracted with florid adenopathy at the base including Calot's node. Postoperatively, the patient required transfusion of packed red cells for a low hemoglobin (6.8 d/dL) but her course was otherwise uneventful. Histopathological examination of the gallbladder revealed a grossly hard, hemorrhagic, greenish pink gallbladder measuring 4.5 cm x 3.5 cm x 2.5 cm, with a wall thickness ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.6 cm. The lumen contained a single 2.5 cm calculus. Calot's node was white and firm measuring 0.6 cm in diameter. Microscopic examination of the gallbladder revealed metastatic infiltrating lobular carcinoma (Figs. 7-9). The final diagnosis was invasive lobular carcinoma of the right breast with metastasis to the bone marrow, endometrium, gallbladder, regional lymph nodes, and peritoneum. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 for follow-up with her oncologist. About one month later, hormonal and chemotherapy were discontinued due to debility and weakness secondary to advanced disease and the patient died shortly thereafter.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4573862/,9,images/PMC4/PMC457/PMC4573862_01
PMC8035581_01,PMC8035581,Female,9.0,"A previously healthy 9-year-old girl presented with a 1-year history of slowly progressive hoarseness and dysphagia. She had no significant history of trauma. The patient denied any neck pain or headache upon presentation to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed left glossopharyngeal, vagus, and hypopharyngeal nerve palsy. Her laboratory data were normal, showing no abnormalities of calcium metabolism or hormones.
Imaging findings revealed a large mass that occupied the clivus. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a calcification of mass lesion with osteolytic changes in the clivus [Figure 1a-c]. The lesion extended from the condyle to the sella turcica. Bilateral condyles were invaded by the lesion and had slightly collapsed. The margin of the lateral side was the medial side of the bilateral internal carotid arteries. The mass also involved the left jugular foramen and hypoglossal canal. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the lesion had relatively low intensity in both T1- and T2-weighted images and was heterogeneously enhanced by gadolinium [Figure 2a-c]. A heavy T2-weighted image revealed that the left glossopharyngeal nerve, vagus nerve, and hypoglossal nerve were encased by the mass. A whole-body CT scan and positron emission tomography revealed no other lesions.
An endoscopic endonasal transclival approach was performed to confirm the pathological finding and to decompress the left lower cranial nerves. Intraoperatively, the lesion was hemorrhagic and white-yellow in color, and consisted of relatively soft tissue [Figure 3a]. Some hard calcifications were present in the lesion as well. The lateral side of the lesion was resected until the C5 portion of the medial side of the internal carotid artery was exposed [Figure 3b]. The upper side of the lesion was resected until normal dura and bone were exposed [Figure 3c]. On the left inferior lateral side, the left hypoglossal canal was opened [Figure 3d]. The lesion around the condyle was not resected to preserve occipito-cervical stability. Transient bilateral abducens nerve palsy newly appeared and disappeared within 3 months. No other complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leak or meningitis occurred. Postoperative imaging findings showed that the lesion was resected between the dorsum sellae and lower clivus without the condyle joint [Figure 4]. Over the last 6 months without other treatment, the residual lesion has not regrown. The deformation of the craniovertebral junction has not changed compared to preoperative findings.
The pathological findings demonstrated an area of calcification with abundant spindle-shaped fibroblasts and multinucleated giant cells. Some focal hemorrhage was present that was surrounded by osteoclast giant cells and inflammatory cell infiltration including neutrophils. No atypical mitotic figures and no mononucleated tumor cells were observed. In addition, immunohistochemical staining revealed that both H3.3G34W and K36M were negative. The final diagnosis was a GCRG [Figure 5].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8035581/,15,images/PMC8/PMC803/PMC8035581_01
PMC7416577_01,PMC7416577,Female,35.0,"The patient was a 35-year-old mestizo woman, who works as a junior manager, with no clinical history of hematuria, bladder tumors or prior surgical interventions and no family history of bladder tumors. The patient presented to the urology practice with a prior history of dysuria, bladder tenesmus, suprapubic pain and urinary urgency for one year, which had been treated as recurrent urinary tract infection with broad spectrum antibiotics. The patient presented negative cultures; however, the symptoms did not disappear. A timeline of the major timepoints in the patient's history, diagnosis and treatment is provided ( Figure 1).
A physical abdominal and genitourinary exploration was carried out. There were no positive findings upon physical examination and no painful trigger points were found. There were no signs of vulvar irritation or palpable abdominal mass.
A bladder screening ultrasound was performed in order to identify any abnormal structure or urinary retention. During the exam the bladder was full, and a bladder dome mass was noted. A unique, polypoid mass with mucoid characteristics of 4.0cm was found using urethrocytoscopy. A lower abdomen contrasted CT scan was performed and a collection/mass was located on the anterior and superior edge of the bladder of 60 by 40mm, which was cystic and solid (density of 30UH) and had peripheral calcifications ( Figure 2). Following this, a transurethral resection was performed. In the transurethral resection pathological report, moderately differentiated muscle invasive mucinous AC was reported. Taking into account these findings, an endoscopy, colonoscopy and mammography were performed, but there was no evidence of tumor in the exams. A solid or cystic mass in the midline with calcifications is considered a major finding indicative of urachal AC and so the diagnosis of urachal AC was proposed.
Mobile solitary tumors that are away from the base may potentially benefit from partial cystectomy, so a partial cystectomy plus extended lymphadenectomy was scheduled ( Figure 3). There were no pre-intervention considerations. The patient was placed in dorsal decubitus position and spinal anesthesia plus epidural catheter, with bupivacaine hydrochloride at 0.5%, without adrenaline and without preservatives, was administered without any complications.
The surgical intervention was performed by an experienced surgeon without complications. A bladder dome mass of approximately 5cm was resected. In the partial cystectomy pathology report, an invasion of the proximal third of muscle layer was described. Clear surgical margins were reported, and no positive lymphatic nodules were found. There was no evidence of infiltration in the area corresponding to the remnant of urachus. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor tested positive for Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and Cytokeratin 7 (CK7) that are distributed in epithelia and their neoplasms. However, the test for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is a marker of colon carcinoma cells, was negative.
The urachus was tumor-free ( Figure 4). However, the bladder layer presented a tumor in its dome without any evidence of secondary AC. Therefore, the final diagnosis was primary bladder AC.
The patient was discharged 10 days after the surgical intervention. Cephalexin 500mg three times a day was prescribed for five days after discharge. The Foley catheter was removed 14 days after surgery. No complications and no urinary fistula were reported. No chemotherapy was administered. No signs of recurrence were observed during a CT scan and urethrocystoscopy performed after a follow-up period of one year.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7416577/,4,images/PMC7/PMC741/PMC7416577_01
PMC6041115_01,PMC6041115,Female,34.0,"A 34 year-old woman was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of thoracic pain lasting from 6 days, dyspnoea, fever, and productive cough. She had a history of smoke and a major thoracic trauma due to a car accident that occurred one year before. A chest X-ray performed on that occasion had ruled out a chest wall injury. At admission to the ED her physical examination showed a painful swelling over the sternum's upper left margin, which had become evident 4 months earlier. A chest X-ray revealed a homogeneous opacity behind the sternum. Blood tests were irrelevant, except for a mildly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP 3.62 mg/dl).
To better characterize the lesion, a chest Computer Tomography (CT) scan was performed. This evaluation showed a retrosternal oval lesion (5.5 x 4 cm) with an intra- and extra-thoracic growth and a multifocal lymphadenopathy ranging between 7 mm and 4 cm in the prevascular area, aortopulmonary window, and right paratracheal station (Fig. 1).
The new findings, together with the young age of the patient, sped up our investigations, and we performed an ultrasound guide biopsy of the retrosternal mass. At histology, the specimen consisted of ""fibroconnectival tissue with necrotic areas, lymphocytic, eosinophilic, and granulocytic infiltrate"". No significant results emerged from cultures. All the additional imaging procedures, including abdominal ultrasound and skeletal scintigraphy, proved inconclusive.
As anti-inflammation therapy was ineffective on dyspnoea and chest pain, a new CT scan was performed 30 days later. The size and characteristics of the retrosternal lesion had not changed, but the scan revealed a new paracardiac lesion showing similar features, a multifocal bone involvement with osteolytic and osteosclerotic areas and multiple, bilateral, pulmonary nodules, suspicious for malignancy. A bilateral, axillary lymphadenopathy was also described.
The retrosternal lesion maintained the same size and features, but there was a deeper bone structural alteration. In the meantime the patient complained of the persistence of pain and dyspnoea, so that a Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT scan was performed. It showed a high metabolic activity lesion in the mediastinum, involving the sternum. These data suggested a malignant aetiology for the mediastinal mass, and therefore a surgical biopsy was performed.
Pathological analysis of the surgical specimen showed a lymphoid lesion surrounded by dense fibrotic tissue. Within the lesion a mixed infiltrate was evidenced, composed of small lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasmacells, and several eosinophils. Furthermore, several mono- or plurinucleated lymphoid cells were present, reminiscent of Reed-Sternberg cells, sometimes surrounded by a clear halo. At immunohistochemistry these cells showed cytoplasmic (often membranous) positivity for CD30 (Fig. 2), and negativity for CLA, CK, CD79 and CD3. The final diagnosis was Hodgkin's lymphoma.
The patient underwent chemotherapy in the Haematology-Oncology Department. The chest CT follow-up showed a great improvement: there was a reduction of the size of the primary lesion and the lymphadenopathy, and a great increase in the degree of mineralization of the sternum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6041115/,1,images/PMC6/PMC604/PMC6041115_01
PMC3015794_01,PMC3015794,Male,74.0,"A 74-year-old male was admitted after 24 hours of abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient had accidentally ingested a mango seed 4 days before developing abdominal pain. He did not have any previous medical conditions or abdominal surgery. A physical examination showed normal vital parameters, a distended abdomen, and no evidence of peritonitis or abdominal external hernias. An abdominal x-ray revealed dilation of the small bowel and a circular image in the inferior right quadrant of the abdomen. A colonoscopy identified a hard mass in the terminal ileum, which could not be removed endoscopically. A laparoscopy by the open technique was performed with a 10-mm port placed in the umbilicus. Pneumoperitoneum was established to a maximum pressure of 13mm Hg. After an initial diagnostic laparoscopy, 2 additional 5-mm working ports were placed under direct vision, 6 cm above the umbilicus and 6cm below it in the middle line of the abdomen. The abdominal cavity was inspected carefully with atraumatic bowel graspers to minimize the risk of bowel injury. A mechanical obstruction due to a hard intraluminal mass was located approximately 5cm from the ileocecal junction (Figure 1). The small bowel was examined from the ligament of Treitz to the cecum to ensure that the obstruction did not involve other areas. Also dilation of the small bowel and ascitic fluid were noted. An ileotomy was performed with a Harmonic scalpel (Ultracision - Ethicon Endo Surgery) along the longitudinal axis (Figure 2), which allowed the removal of a 5.0x5.0x4.0-cm phytobezoar that could not be milked towards the colon (Figure 3). The phytobezoar was extracted in a latex bag (Figure 4). A larger incision on the umbilicus was made to facilitate the removal of the bezoar. The ileotomy was closed along the longitudinal axis with interrupted suture using 3-0 Vicryl (Figure 5). The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient stayed in the hospital for 4 days. The final diagnosis was intraluminal small-bowel obstruction due to phytobezoar (mango seed).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3015794/,3,images/PMC3/PMC301/PMC3015794_01
PMC5410487_01,PMC5410487,Male,75.0,"A 75-year-old man was admitted to Kitano Hospital with muscle weakness, muscle pain, rash, arthralgia, severe dysphagia, and a fever. He had a one-month history of rash on the extensor surfaces of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints on both hands and on the eyelids, and a two-week history of symmetrical proximal muscle weakness in the upper and lower limbs and poor oral intake. He had been smoking 40 cigarettes a day for 40 years. He was a precision polishing worker, with no history of exposure to either radiation or industrial chemicals. A physical examination revealed cutaneous manifestations of Gottron's sign and heliotrope rash. Medical research council (MRC) scale for muscle strength was grade 3 for the upper and lower limb muscles. Laboratory tests showed the following: creatine kinase (CK), 15,242 IU/L (normal, <248 IU/L); myoglobin, 2,504 ng/mL (normal, <73 ng/mL); aldolase, 31.6 U/mL (normal, <4.9 U/ml); C-reactive protein, 2.53 mg/dL (normal, <0.14 mg/dL); and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 42 mm/h (normal, <20 mm/h). The results for anti-nuclear antibody were positive (1:80, speckled) with the indirect immunofluorescence test (normal, <1:40). Anti-transcriptional intermediary factor 1-gamma antibody was positive, but negative results were obtained for antibodies to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Jo-1, PL-7, PL-12, OJ, and EJ), signal recognition particle (SRP), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5), Ku, and Mi-2. Magnetic resonance imaging showed signal hyperintensities on short T1 inversion recovery images in the deltoid, biceps, triceps, trapezius, infraspinatus, and supraspinatus muscles. Electromyogram and muscle biopsy were not performed. Computed tomography revealed no evidence of interstitial pneumonia. Dermatomyositis was diagnosed based on the criteria of Bohan and Peter (probable; symmetric proximal muscle weakness, elevation of serum skeletal muscle enzymes, and skin rash). Oral prednisolone (PSL) at 70 mg/day (1 mg/kg/day) was initiated and elicited a prompt response. The patient's clinical course is shown in Fig. 1. The symptoms such as cutaneous manifestations, muscle weakness, and dysphagia, as well as the laboratory data, all promptly improved. The MRC scale for muscle strength became grade 4 for the upper and lower limb muscles. Notably, administration of PSL improved the patient's oral intake. Muscle enzyme levels normalized (e.g. CK, 226 IU/L; normal, <248 IU/L) by Day 14.
The possibility of malignancy was examined during the diagnosis and treatment of dermatomyositis. Computed tomography revealed a nodule, 13 mm in diameter, in the upper lobe of the right lung and lymph node swelling in the left lower neck and right mediastinum (Fig. 2). No evidence of other primary tumors or metastases was seen in the stomach, colon, liver, kidney, pancreas, prostate, or brain. Furthermore, stomach and colon cancers were not detected on gastroscopy and colonoscopy. Analyses of tumor markers showed the following: carcinoembryonic antigen, 1.2 ng/mL (normal, <5 ng/mL); carbohydrate antigen 19-9, 2.2 U/mL (normal, <37 U/mL); cytokeratin 19 fragment, 1.82 ng/mL (normal, <2.08 ng/mL); squamous cell carcinoma antigen, 0.6 ng/mL (normal, <2.0 ng/mL); neuron specific gamma-enolase, 83.7 ng/mL (normal, <16.3 ng/mL); and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide, 24.1 pg/mL (normal, <81 pg/mL). Biopsy of a mediastinal lymph node was performed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (Fig. 3). The tumor cells were of a medium size and had a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, fine chromatin, and inconspicuous nucleoli. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), partially positive for synaptophysin and CD56, and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1. Based on these findings, lung neuroendocrine carcinoma (large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma [LCNEC] or small cell lung cancer [SCLC]; TxN3M0) was diagnosed. A cytological diagnosis of LCNEC or SCLC could not be made in our case, as SCLC is difficult to distinguish from LCNEC in some cases. The final diagnosis was lung neuroendocrine carcinoma associated with dermatomyositis.
On Day 15, the dose of PSL was decreased to 55 mg/day, and chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide was initiated. Chemotherapy was repeated monthly. The patient received four cycles of chemotherapy. Whether patients diagnosed with lung neuroendocrine carcinoma should be treated with non-SCLC (NSCLC)- or SCLC-based regimes remains unclear. Current treatment strategies for patients with lung neuroendocrine carcinoma are a mixture between the guidelines for NSCLC and SCLC patients. As we were unable to distinguish SCLC from LCNEC in our case, the patient was treated in accordance with the standard international protocol for SCLC.
Within two weeks after starting chemotherapy, his muscle power had normalized, and the CK level had decreased to 54 IU/L. The MRC scale for muscle strength became grade 5 for the upper and lower limb muscles. The cutaneous manifestations were improved two months after starting chemotherapy. The swelling in the mediastinum lymph nodes also disappeared two months after starting chemotherapy (Fig. 2). PSL was successfully tapered to 15 mg/day after 3 months and 10 mg/day after 6 months. No complications associated with immunosuppression were identified during the clinical course. As of the time of writing, 5 months after completion of chemotherapy, the patient is continuing to receive 7 mg/day of PSL.
We conducted a systemic review of the Medline database through the PubMed website of articles published from January 1947 to December 2015 using a combination of the following terms: ""dermatomyositis"", ""small cell lung"", and ""lung neuroendocrine"". Non-English articles were excluded.

PMC6394359_01,PMC6394359,Female,36.0,"A 36-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department of the Cancer Center, complaining of fever, chills, night sweats, diarrhea, and painful oral lesions, over the past3 days. The patient had a medical history of liver transplantation8 years before, due to biliary cirrhosis, and was taking prednisone 5mg/day and mycophenolate sodium 360 mg. She also reported cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection 3 months after the transplantation, which was successfully treated with ganciclovir. The oral examination showed three well-defined shallow ulcerative lesions covered by fibrin with regular erythematous borders on the hard palate, measuring 1 cm (Figure 1A); on the vestibular and palatal gingiva between the 16 and 17 teeth measuring 0.5 cm (Figure 1B); and on the left soft palate near the uvula measuring 1.0 cm (Figure 1C).
According to the clinical findings and the previous history of CMV, the main diagnostic hypotheses were CMV reactivation or herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Exfoliative cytology of oral lesions was performed and an anti-CMV immunoglobulin (Ig)G test was requested. Because of the immunosuppression, ganciclovir 300mg tid was prescribed, but no improvement was observed within 7 days. Since the exfoliative cytology and the anti-CMV IgG tests were negative, the hypothesis of viral infection became less probable. A chest x-ray was normal, which ruled out lung involvement. Due to the worsening of oral lesions and the presence of gastrointestinal tract symptoms, two oral incisional biopsies:in the gingival and the palate:were taken, and a colonoscopy was performed with biopsy of a rectal lesion. The colonoscopy image showed areas with inflammatory process and eroded mucosa with an extensive ulcer measuring 2 cm on the descending colon extending to the rectum (Figure 2).
Histological sections of oral cavity biopsies revealed fragments of squamous mucosa with intense histiocytic inflammatory infiltrate associated with rounded fungal structures, which were consistent with H. capsulatum, and were confirmed by Gomori-Grocott's staining in the gum and the palate (Figure 3). Similar findings were observed in the rectal biopsy. Based on the clinical and histopathologic findings, the final diagnosis was histoplasmosis (Figure 4).
The treatment consisted of itraconazole 300 mg/day with significant improvement of local and systemic symptoms after 7 days (Figure 5). The patient was followed up for 12 months with no further lesions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6394359/,6,images/PMC6/PMC639/PMC6394359_01
PMC8258638_01,PMC8258638,Female,72.0,"A 72-year-old woman without any underlying disease presented to our surgical outpatient department (OPD) with a 5-month history of a nodule in the left supraclavicular area and a 1-month history of a mass in the left para-spinal area of the upper back. The patient did not report fever, night sweating, cough, or weight loss. Physical examination revealed a suspicious soft tissue swelling in the left supraclavicular and thoracic spine region. Chest computed tomography and serum tumor marker (CEA; CA-125; CA-153; CA-199) assessments revealed a hypodensity lesion with ring enhancement in the left supraclavicular area and multiple small nodules in bilateral lungs with bilateral mild pleural effusion (Fig. 1A). Tumor markers were all within normal limits. Fine needle aspiration of the supraclavicular and thoracic spine lesions was performed for bacterial culture. Empirical antibiotic therapy was prescribed to the patient. The bacterial culture revealed no growth after 1 week. Because the swelling persisted, incision and drainage of both lesions was performed, and notable volume of pus was seen at both sites (Figs. 1B, 2 A). Although we continued the wound care and antibiotic therapy, the swelling persisted, and the wound did not heal. The patient was referred to the infectious diseases OPD for a second opinion. On reviewing the patient's medical history and data, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) lymphadenitis was suspected, and a swab sample was collected from the deep supraclavicular wound for TB culture, acid-fast staining, and TB polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Acid-fast staining revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli on the subsequent day, and TB PCR test returned positive 2 days later. A combination anti-TB regimen was started immediately. Thoracic spine wound and sputum TB survey were conducted simultaneously. The sputum and wound swab tested positive on TB PCR, and the patient was placed in airborne isolation. Although pulmonary TB was confirmed, no respiratory symptoms were noted during the disease course. The patient denied any possibility of HIV infection and refused HIV screening. No exposure history or risk factors of MTB infection were noted. The patient reported a persistent back pain and developed bilateral lower extremity numbness and weakness gradually. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a hypointensity signal at the T8-T9 level on T1-weighted imaging and a hyperintensity signal at the same level on T2-weighted imaging with spinal cord compression (Fig. 2B, C). A laminectomy of the thoracic spine was performed with spinal fixation. The tissue sample from the spine was positive on acid-fast staining and TB PCR. Spinal TB was confirmed. After combination therapy with isoniazid/rifampin/ethambutol/pyrazinamide, the swelling in supraclavicular and thoracic lesions disappeared gradually, and the incision wound healed finally. After the surgical intervention, back pain resolved, and the patient regained muscle strength of bilateral lower extremities gradually. Before discharge, TB cultures from the supraclavicular and thoracic wounds, sputum, and spine tissue were all positive and identified as TB complex. The final diagnosis was confirmed as disseminated TB, including pulmonary TB, TB lymphadenitis (supraclavicular), TB spine (T8-T9), and cutaneous TB. Cutaneous TB presented as scrofuloderma, extending from the contiguous lesions, the underlying TB lymphadenitis, and TB spine. After 50 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged from the hospital and was prescribed a rehabilitation program and an anti-TB regimen at OPD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8258638/,2,images/PMC8/PMC825/PMC8258638_01
PMC9030344_01,PMC9030344,Male,37.0,"A 37-year-old chronic alcoholic and smoker, and daily wage laborer male of Indian descent presented with dysphagia, early satiety, and significant weight loss for 2 months; referred for abdomen ultrasonography (USG). On USG [Figure 1 and Video 1], a large heterogeneously hypoechoic exophytic mass was seen filling the lumen of the stomach with no obvious vascularity on Doppler. The gastresophageal junction was not well appreciated. The lesion was also seen infiltrating into the adjacent liver parenchyma. The diagnosis of a gastric neoplastic lesion with adjacent liver infiltration was made with differentials of the gastrointestinal (GI) stromal tumor.
On the oral barium examination (barium swallow and meal) Figure 2, a filling defect was seen in the lower esophagus at the 8th and 9th thoracic vertebrae levels. Apart from this, a distortion of the shape of the gastric barium column was seen with a large filling defect in the region of the stomach's fundus and upper body. The differential diagnoses were esophageal malignancy with gastric metastasis, gastric neoplasm with esophageal metastasis, and dual malignancy of the esophagus and stomach.
For further imaging workup, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen and thorax was performed [Figure 3]. CECT demonstrated an intraluminal proliferative mass lesion involving the distal esophagus at the previously described vertebral levels without significant locoregional lymphadenopathy. Another large heterogeneously enhancing exophytic mass lesion was seen protruding into the stomach lumen; predominately in the cardia, fundus, and upper body region extending to involve the gastresophageal junction. However, there was no direct communication between the esophageal lesion and the stomach lesion. The rest of the stomach was normal. The stomach lesion showed infiltration into the adjacent left lobe of the liver.
The patient had later undergone upper GI endoscopy and biopsy of both lesions. On upper GI endoscopy [Figure 4], a small proliferative growth was seen in the lower esophagus (D8-9 level) with luminal narrowing, and the scope was negotiable. Another large diffuse proliferative growth was seen in the lumen of the stomach, extending from gastresophageal junction to midbody, involving the entire circumference. Multiple biopsies were taken from both the lesions and sent for histopathological examination.
Histopathological examination [Figure 5] showed an infiltrating tumor of squamous origin with large polygonal cells in sheets and nests from both the lesions. These cells had vesicular chromatin and occasional nucleoli. Cytoplasm occasionally showed dyskeratosis and vacuolations. These findings were corroborative of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Alcian blue and Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain was used to look for intracellular mucin to rule out adenocarcinoma.
The final diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus with intramural gastric metastasis and surrounding liver parenchymal infiltration. The patient was put on symptomatic management and neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9030344/,7,images/PMC9/PMC903/PMC9030344_01
PMC3551489_01,PMC3551489,Female,16.0,"A 16-year-old girl presented with a 6-month history of primary amenorrhea and pain in the abdomen. She also noticed excessive facial hair growth during the 6-month period. The weight of the patient was 55 kg. The height was normal for her age. She had normal secondary sexual development. There was male pattern of hair distribution [Figure 1]. Breast development was Tanner Stage IV. Pubic hair development was Tanner Stage V. Clitomegaly was present. Uterus and adenexa were normal on per rectal examination. Her blood pressure was normal and there was no diabetes mellitus. The total testosterone level was raised and value was 435 ng/dl (normal range, 14-76 ng/dl). Dehydroepiandrosteronesulfate (DHEA-S) level was >1500 mug/dl (normal range, 61-493 mug/dl). Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) level was 10.10 mg/24 h (normal range, <15.0 mg/24 h). Rest of the blood parameters were normal.
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed on a 64-slice multidetector MDCT scanner (GE light speed VCT XTe whole body 64 slice CT system from Wipro GE Healthcare Private Limited). On noncontrast CT scan, there was a well-defined hypodense mass of size 11.6 x 10.7 x 12 cm, with scattered areas of calcifications. Center of the mass showed a stellate shaped noticeably hypodense area. Plain CT attenuation was around 59 HU. Arterial phase scan (acquired at 30 s) showed a tangle of serpiginous, thin intratumoral vessels throughout the mass except in the central stellate nonenhancing area [Figure 2]. These vessels gave a can-of-worms like appearance on volume rendered images [Figure 3]. The periphery of the mass was supplied by dilated, thick, tortuous vessels arising from phrenic and renal vessels [Figure 2]. The average postcontrast attenuation of the mass was around 70HU. It had a thin intensely enhancing capsule. In the venous phase scan (acquired at 60 s), the mass showed homogenous enhancement except for the central nonenhancing area [Figure 4]. The values were in the range of around 103 HU. The right kidney was pushed inferomedially by this mass. The fat planes with liver were maintained. There was no lymphadenopathy or ascites. Big vessels were normal.
Open right adrenalectomy was performed. The tumor was round in shape and well encapsulated [Figure 5]. It was highly vascular and had blood supply from the aorta, renal, and phrenic vessels. The histopathological examination showed oncocytic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and small round nuclei. There was no mitosis. Necrosis was seen in the smears [Figure 6]. The final diagnosis was testosterone secreting adrenocortical oncocytoma. The recovery was uneventful and features of virilization receded in follow-up done after 3 months.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3551489/,6,images/PMC3/PMC355/PMC3551489_01
PMC5824527_01,PMC5824527,Male,59.0,"A59-year-old male reported with a chief complaint of a growth on the left side of upper lip. The lesion had been present for the last 6 months with gradual increase in size. Previously, the patient had undergone surgical excision of the lesion twice in the same area from an outside clinic only to notice it regrow again. He had the habit of smoking cigarettes for the past 25 years, around 20 cigarettes per day. The patient also gave a history of anemia for the past 1 month and was taking folic acid medication regularly. No other signs and symptoms were present.
On close clinical examination, an exophytic growth was seen on the left corner of upper lip. The growth was about 1.5 cm in length and was brown. On palpation, the growth was firm to hard in consistency and was slightly tender. Intraoral examination revealed a grayish-white patch on the left commissural mucosa and the dorsum of tongue measuring about 3 cm x 1 cm in dimension. Both the white patches were nontender and nonscrapable in nature. Hard tissue examination revealed several missing teeth (15, 16, 17, 25, 26, 27 and 46) and Grade II mobility with respect to teeth (11, 21, 22, 23, 31, 41, 42 and 47). Generalized gingival recession and attrition were also seen in Figure 1.
Excision of the lesion on the lip along with its adjacent grayish-white patch was done using CO2 laser. Satisfactory healing was observed after a week. The gross specimen received measured about 28 mm x 7 mm x 4 mm. One end of the specimen was soft in consistency, and the other end was firm which represents the horn [Figure 2].
The histological sections revealed hyperkeratotic stratified squamous epithelium with underlying connective tissue. The epithelium exhibited acanthosis, spongiosis, hyperkeratosis and broad rete pegs with pushing margins along with parakeratinized keratin plugging. The underlying connective tissue exhibited mild inflammatory cell infiltration, areas of hemorrhage and muscle fibers bundles in cross sections [Figure 3]. The superficial layer of epithelium in one area showed exuberant keratinization in concentric layers forming a cutaneous horn [Figure 4]. The final diagnosis was given as cutaneous horn with underlying verrucous carcinoma. Histopathologic sections from the tissue adjacent to the cutaneous horn showed features of mild-to-moderate dysplasia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5824527/,4,images/PMC5/PMC582/PMC5824527_01
PMC6445037_01,PMC6445037,Male,63.0,"A 63-year-old male came to our clinic due to progressively enlarging masses over the bilateral posterior neck for more than 1 year. There was no fever, body weight loss, nasal obstruction/bleeding, facial numbness/swelling, aural fullness, dry mouth, hemoptysis, short of breath, chest pain, or other discomfort mentioned. Physical examination revealed multiple, nontender, mobile, and solid masses in the posterior triangle region. No thyroid mass was found. No redness or swelling over preauricular, submandibular, or mouth floor region was noted. His bilateral tympanic membrane was intact. Oral cavity examination and nasopharyngoscopic examination revealed no remarkable findings. Review of system also showed negative findings. US was performed using a color Doppler US unit (Toshiba Aplio 500) and a 5-14 MHz broadband linear array transducer [Video]. Multiple matted, ovoid, homogenous, hypoechoic and enlarged lymph nodes [Figure 1] were seen below the right parotid gland. There was also heterogeneous echotextures with small and indistinct hypoechoic nodules over bilateral parotid and submandibular glands [Figure 2]. US-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) of the right neck lymphadenopathies was performed. A 9 cm length modified nonadvancing, disposable, spring-loaded 18 gauze cutting biopsy needle (Temno biopsy system, Allegiance Healthcare corp., McGaw Park, IL, USA) with 15-mm side-notch was used for CNB. Two cores of tissue were sent for the pathological examination. The pathology suggested reactive hyperplasia. However, it was difficult to exclude low-grade lymphoma due to incomplete architectural evaluation of the biopsy specimens; therefore, the patient underwent excisional biopsy of the right neck lymph node. Laboratory examination showed marked elevation of serum IgG4 (4660 mg/dL). The white blood cell count (6.85 k/muL), anti-Ro antibody (17 AU/ml), and anti-La antibody (30 AU/ml) were within normal limit. The pathology of excisional biopsy specimens revealed reactive hyperplasia with scattered plasma cells in germinal centers and mildly increased plasma cells in interfollicular areas [Figure 3]. Focal penetration of blood vessels in the germinal center was also noted. Immunostainings for IgG and IgG4 revealed that the ratio of IgG4+/IgG+ plasma cells were >40% [Figure 4]. The final diagnosis was IgG4-RD. The patient received oral steroid therapy, and the lymph nodes completely regressed 1 week later without recurrence after 3 months of follow-up.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6445037/,3,images/PMC6/PMC644/PMC6445037_01
PMC8716851_01,PMC8716851,Female,55.0,"A 55-year-old female patient complained of dizziness, headache, blurred and double vision lasting for three weeks. Physical examination confirmed the existence of Parinaud syndrome, including up gaze palsy and convergence-retraction nystagmus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) further confirmed a heterogeneously enhancing lobulated mass extending into the bilateral thalamus and obliterating the third ventricle, with associated ventriculomegaly ( Figures 1A-D ).
After being admitted to the hospital, she developed a sudden worsening headache followed by a decreased consciousness. The patient was immediately transferred to the operating room for external ventricular drainage (EVD) via a frontal burr-hole. Lateral supracerebellar infratentorial approach was performed the next morning for microsurgical resection of this midline pineal region tumor. Unfortunately, the tumor was partially removed because of copious bleeding. Her symptoms did not improve significantly after repeated therapeutic lumbar punctures (LP). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow study demonstrated the worsening ventriculomegaly with obstruction of CSF flow. Consequently, she underwent a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt to resolve the hydrocephalus. Then she proceeded to have an unremarkable hospital course and was discharged soon ( Figure 1E ).
H&E-stained sections showed high density of tumor cells with elevated mitotic activity, vascular proliferation, necrosis with pseudopalisading, and perivascular pseudorosettes ( Figures 2A, B ). Immunohistochemical staining was performed and demonstrated that the tumor cells expressed P53 ( Figure 2C ), CD99 ( Figure 2D ), GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein,  Figure 2E ), synaptophysin (Syn,  Figure 2F ), Olig-2 ( Figure 2G ), and IDH1 ( Figure 2H ). The Ki-67 proliferative index was high, approximately 30-40% ( Figure 2I ). In addition, the ATRX was negatively expressed in tumor cells ( Figure 2J ). In conclusion, the histological diagnosis was GBM.
To further clarify its molecular characteristics, a comprehensive genomic profiling was performed using a 131 cancer-related genes panel based on NGS analysis via DNA-based hybrid capture in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded primary tumor tissue ( Additional File 1 ). Remarkably, the NGS analysis revealed the presence of TERT amplification (~8.94 fold) without TERTp mutation. Further sequencing showed presence of multiple TERT fusions [TERT (Exon16-2)-NUBPL (Exon4-11), MARCH6 (Exon1-25)-TERT (Intergenic) and CJD4 (Intergenic)-TERT (Exon10-16),  Figure 3 ] and also FGFR2 fusions [CXCL17 (Intergenic)-FGFR2 (Exon16-18), SIPA1L3 (Exon1-4)-FGFR2 (Exon16-18), FGFR2 (Exon1-16)-SIPA1L3 (Exon4-1), and FGFR2 (Exon1-16)-CEACAM1 (Intergenic),  Figure 4 ], both of which were rarely reported previously. CDKN2A/CDKN2B loss, TP53 mutation (p.H179R), and 19q chromosome deletion were also positive (data not shown). In contrast, IDH1, IDH2, BRAF V600E, H3F3A, HIST1H3B, HIST1H3C, ATRX, EGFR, RELA, YAP1, MYB, and NF1 mutations were not identified. Also, O (6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter was unmethylated. The final diagnosis was GBM, IDH-wild type, WHO grade IV, based on the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumors and cIMPACT-NOW workgroup.
After the discharge, the patient received radiotherapy. Considering the unfavorable molecular profiling and MGMT promoter methylation status, we advised the attempt of Pemigatinib, a potent inhibitor of FGFRs, but she refused and decided to receive temozolomide chemotherapy. Unfortunately, her condition deteriorated rapidly due to the malignant nature of the tumor. The patient eventually died with an overall survival of 3 months.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8716851/,21,images/PMC8/PMC871/PMC8716851_01
PMC7757942_01,PMC7757942,Female,31.0,"A healthy 31-year-old woman visited the department of oral health sciences of the university hospital in Leuven for a second opinion. The main complaint was a shiny smooth nodule on her chin that had been present for almost a year (Figure 1a, b). The patient experienced no pain, and there were no details worth mentioning in the medical history of the patient; she took no medication and had no allergies. Previous surgical intervention by a dermatologist had not resolved the problem. Based on the histological examination of an earlier lesion removed by the dermatologist, the diagnosis of exuberant granulation tissue was made (Figure 2a, b).
During extraoral inspection, a red lobulated exophytic lesion could be seen at the left of her chin (Figure 3a). Since the beginning, the patient wore a bandage over the lesion for aesthetic reasons, and this had caused an allergic irritation of the surrounding skin. The nodule bled easily upon palpation, it was compressible, and it had a sessile base (Video 00:00-00:48, See Page: https://doi.org/10.5152/eej.2017.17007). Closer examination using the dental microscope (Opmi Pico, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) revealed a highly vascular tissue of approximately 0.8 inches in width (Figure 3b).
Clinical intra-oral examination revealed poor dental hygiene. All teeth, except tooth 32, reacted positively to cold testing with carbon dioxide snow. None of the teeth were tender to percussion. Pocket depths of 5 mm were probed around tooth 32, but no pocket reached the apex. Periapical radiography showed a periapical lesion associated with tooth 32 (Figure 4a). The patient could remember a trauma in her childhood where she fell on the mandibular front teeth. Palpation of the M. mentalis revealed firm muscle tension accompanied with strong lip pressure. A CBCT scan (3D Accuitomo  170, J. Morita MFG Corp, Kyoto, Japan) was acquired to assess the extensiveness of the lesion in three dimensions (Figure 5a-c). The scanning parameters were 90kVp, 5 mA, a spatial resolution of 160 mum and a field-of-view of 80x80 mm. Information about the anatomy of the root, the dimensions of the lesion and the relation with the surrounding tissues was visualised. Cortical expansion of the bone with discrete vestibular disruption was seen.
The final diagnosis was made of an odontogenic cutaneous sinus tract with exuberant granulation tissue secondary to a necrotic pulp with asymptomatic apical periodontitis of tooth 32. The tooth was endodontically treated following the quality guidelines for endodontic treatment as described in the consensus report of the European Society of Endodontology (Figure 4b, c).
A betamethasonevalerate 0.1%-based ointment in combination with zinc oxide 10% was prescribed to apply twice a day onto the red nodule for a period of 10 days. Professional periodontal treatment was conducted afterwards. One month later, the granulation tissue was reduced in size (Figure 3c). The ointment with zinc oxide 10% but without the corticosteroid was continued for another 4 weeks. Two months later, the formation of scar tissue could be seen at the borders of the lesion. Three months later, periapical radiography showed no clear signs of healing (Figure 4d), a purulent exudate was visible (Figure 3d) and the sinus tract could still be explored with a gutta percha cone (Video 00:49-00:58, See Page: https://doi.org/10.5152/eej.2017.17007). Because of the remaining purulent exudate, a microbiological sample was taken from the sinus tract for bacterial identification. Actinomyces oris, Streptococcus sanguinis and Porphyromonas gingivalis were identified. A supplementary antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin (875 mg) and clavulanic acid (125 mg) (Augmentin ) combined with metronidazole for 10 days was started. One month after the antibiotic therapy and 4 months after initial therapy, the extraoral granuloma had completely disappeared. Only a small scar at the left of her chin could be noticed (Figure 3e). The original connecting fibrous tissue cord inside the chin could still be palpated.
Periapical radiography showed ongoing healing after 6 months and full healing after 1 year (Figure 4e, f). Because the patient was part of an ongoing randomised controlled clinical trial (NCT02528240, approved by the Ethics Committee of UZ Leuven) comparing periapical healing of non-surgical endodontic treatment versus endodontic microsurgery using CBCT, a follow up CBCT was taken to evaluate the bone healing. Bone healing could be seen in all three dimensions, and the cortical disruption was closed (Figure 5d-f). Extraoral inspection revealed the presence of a discrete scar (Figure 3f) (Video 00:59-01:30, See Page: https://doi.org/10.5152/eej.2017.17007). However, the patient had no complaints and was satisfied with the healing so no further aesthetic treatments were planned (Figure 6a, b).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7757942/,10,images/PMC7/PMC775/PMC7757942_01
PMC7193198_01,PMC7193198,Female,32.0,"A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 2, presented to our institution with a history of progressively worsening abdominal pain over the past 2 months. She reported intermittent, suprapubic, and central abdominal pain with associated nausea, weight gain, abdominal distension, early satiety, constipation, and urinary frequency. Similar episodes of pain were diagnosed as Helicobacter pylori induced gastritis and treated unsuccessfully with proton-pump inhibitors. Tumor markers revealed elevated CA 125 (244.9) and CA 19-9 (76).
A computed tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis were performed per discretion of the ordering emergency room physician, which revealed a large heterogeneous mass in the left adnexa measuring 19 x 17 x 10.4 cm, containing fat, calcification, and soft-tissue consistent with a teratoma [Figures 1a-1b, 2a-b]. However, there was a significant mass effect, mesenteric/omental stranding, and ascites concerning for malignant transformation and peritoneal carcinomatosis versus intraperitoneal rupture with resultant granulomatous peritonitis [Figures 1a and 2a]. Further findings included a mature ovarian teratoma measuring 5.4 x 5.4 x 6.9 cm in the right adnexa [Figure 2b].
Although surgery was indicated, initial evaluation in the emergency department demonstrated severe hyponatremia (serum sodium of 116 mmol/L), and our patient was admitted for management in the MICU. Initially, her hyponatremia responded to fluid resuscitation (serum sodium 125 mmol/L) and she was transferred to the gynecology team for further work-up; however, she required readmission to the MICU for refractory hyponatremia (serum sodium 118 mmol/L). Her serum sodium corrected after management with fluid restriction and salt tablets, and she was transferred to gynecology for planned surgery. Pre-operative laboratories demonstrated serum sodium 130 mmol/L, plasma osmolality 240 mmol/L, urinary sodium 220 mWq/L, and urine osmolality 779 mEq/L. Other preoperative laboratories indicated normal adrenal and thyroid function.
Intraoperative findings confirmed bilateral ovarian masses and ascites; however, gross peritoneal carcinomatosis was not reported. Samples were then sent for surgical pathology following bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and pelvic lymph node dissections. Our patient's sodium levels immediately increased to normal after surgery and continued to normalize as she was weaned off of fluids and salt tablets.
Macroscopic examination of the bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy specimen revealed a 21.5 x 17.5 x 8.5 cm focally disrupted, enlarged left ovary and an 8.0 x 6.0 x 5.5 cm cystic right ovary. The outer surface of the left ovary was remarkable for numerous adhesions with a 12.0 x 6.0 x 0.5 cm portion of omentum attached. Serial sectioning revealed numerous tan- white and tan-yellow solid and cystic areas admixed with hair, skin, and cartilaginous tissues. The outer surface of the right ovary was remarkable for a scant amount of adhesions. It was filled with yellow mucoid material including skin, cartilage, and teeth attached to the inner lining of the ovarian wall.
Microscopically, the left ovary revealed a solid tumor with areas of neurotubules and neuroepithelial rosettes [Figure 3a-d] along with mature components including skin appendages, cartilages, and pancreatic and neural glial tissues [Figure 4a-c]. The diagnosis of immature teratoma (Grade 2) was made based on the presence of neurotubules in two low-power fields as described previously. The right ovary, on the other hand, consisted of all mature components and, therefore, represented a mature cystic teratoma [Figure 4d-f]. The nodules in the uterine serosa, rectal peritoneum, and omentum were composed of mature, predominantly gliomatosis admixed with adipose tissue [Figure 5a-d], which occurs in about one-third of the cases with immature teratoma.
The patient's serum sodium returned to normal 24 h after surgery and stabilized at about 138 mEq/L. The final diagnosis was FIGO Stage 1A Grade 2 immature teratoma, and the patient started 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin. Since her surgery, there has been no evidence of recurrent disease and her tumor markers have stabilized at normal levels. The patient has not shown symptoms or objective evidence of recurrent hyponatremia, as well.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193198/,8,images/PMC7/PMC719/PMC7193198_01
PMC8641627_01,PMC8641627,Female,39.0,"Patient information: a female term neonate was delivered on February 20, 2021, at Cape Coast Teaching Hospital Ghana via emergency caesarean section on account of poor progress of labour with acute fetal distress. The birth weight was 3.8kg and Apgar scores were 2/10 and 5/10 at the first and fifth minute respectively. The baby was the 5th child of a couple, a 39-year-old man and a 34-year-old woman, in a non-consanguineous marriage and with no known family history of congenital anomalies. From a family picture, no other nuclear family member was found to have similar physical features. The neonate was discharged after spending a total of 20 days on admission at the Special Baby Care Unit of the Hospital. The baby died 5 months later.
Clinical findings: the baby was noticed on the day of admission to the unit to have the following dysmorphic features; macrocephaly evidenced by an occipitofrontal circumference of 38.8cm (95th centile) with widely gaped sagittal sutures, proptosis with ocular hypertelorism (Figure 1), low set ears, protruding tongue, mandibular prognathism, ankylosed elbows, sacral dimple, wide sandal gap and medially deviated broad great toes (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The clinical problems identified on initial assessment were respiratory distress which was evidenced by deep laboured breathing with poor oxygen saturation of 55% on room air, seizures of the upper limbs, high-grade fever, and pallor. Other examination findings identified were bilaterally fused coronal sutures. The parents were counselled on the child s condition. The child was later noticed to be drooling most of the time and on that note, ENT was consulted.
Diagnostic assessment: an initial complete blood count showed an elevated WBC of 24.8 x 109/L with an accompanying increase in lymphocytes of 15.7 x 109/L; low hemoglobin 10.6g/dl, other parameters were normal. A repeat complete blood count done 6 days later showed an elevated WBC of 21.51 x 109/L with an accompanying increase in neutrophils of 12.48 x 109/L and low hemoglobin of 9.4g/dl with other parameters being normal. The results from both blood and urine culture and sensitivity tests yielded no bacterial growth. CSF bacteriology and biochemistry did not yield any significant findings. Liver function tests and serum electrolytes including calcium, magnesium and phosphate were essentially normal. Renal function was deranged with high serum creatinine and urea of 500.3micromol/L and 34.36mol/L respectively but normalized throughout the admission. Imaging investigations done included chest x-ray, bedside echocardiogram, and abdominal ultrasound, all of which yielded normal anatomical findings. A challenge encountered was the malfunctioning of the CT scan machine at the hospital.
Diagnosis: Pfeiffer syndrome among other diagnoses such as Apert and Crouzon syndromes was initially considered. Other diagnoses were early-onset neonatal sepsis complicated by severe anaemia, moderate hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, acute kidney injury and upper airway obstruction. The final diagnosis was Pfeiffer syndrome type 3 with FGR2 c.1052C>G (p.Ser351Cys) variant.
Therapeutic interventions: IV phenobarbitone and phenytoin were administered to control the seizures; IV benzylpenicillin 0.38mu twice daily and gentamicin19mg 36 hourly were administered for the first 5 days, then switched to IV flucloxacillin 190mg twice daily and cefotaxime 190mg twice daily for the subsequent 7 days due to unsettling fever. Finally, IV meropenem 68mg for 6 days was given. Oxygen support was administered via CPAP and the baby was haemotransfused.
Follow-up and outcome of interventions: fever finally settled after completing 6 days of intravenous meropenem, she was weaned off supplemental oxygen support as respiratory distress improved, and feeding was established orally via a nasogastric tube gradually increased to even surpass the daily fluid requirement. Baby graduated from feeding via nasogastric tube to cup feeding. She was discharged with scheduled follow-up visits. The baby was seen twice on an outpatient basis and her condition was satisfactory. A blood sample sent for molecular studies at Invitae Medical Genetic laboratory revealed a heterozygous pathogenic variant in intron 8 of the FGFR2 gene, c.1052C>G (p.Ser351Cys). This result came in after we had received a phone call from the parents on August 9, 2021, about the death of the child the day before. The child was reported to have become lethargic and died some hours after reporting to the district hospital. An autopsy was not done. The parents have been counselled on the findings of the genetic study.
Patient perspective: the parents were counselled on a tracheostomy for the baby. However, they changed their mind a day afterwards because they were doubtful of the successful outcome of the procedure. On day 12 of admission, the parents opted for the baby to be discharged against medical advice on account of poor progress in the condition. The mother of the child even threatened to abandon her if their wish was not granted. The couple was taken through another extensive education and counselling and assured of discharge once the baby's clinical condition improved significantly.
Informed consent: an informed consent for photographic documentation and anonymous use as well as genetic testing was sought and obtained from the mother of the baby. The consent forms used were obtained through the Rare Disease Ghana Initiative diagnostic program.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8641627/,3,images/PMC8/PMC864/PMC8641627_01
PMC7517663_01,PMC7517663,Female,25.0,"A 25-year old primigravida at 29 weeks' gestation noticed pain and swelling in her right wrist; these symptoms worsened rapidly over the course of 2 months. Initially, she thought she had tendinitis of the wrist. She reported no fever and no general fatigue. Her medical history was significant for smoking 20 cigarettes per day before her pregnancy. She was an office worker and had no chance to handle plants or animals; she kept no pets. She had no history of gastroenteritis to suggest Salmonella infection, nor did she have a history of sickle cell disease or immunodeficiency. She did have a history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia associated with human papillomavirus infection and a benign cystic mass of the right ovary that was under observation. She had no history of trauma to the wrist or bone infection of the distal radius.
She visited a nearby hospital and was referred to our institution with a working diagnosis of malignancy because of the rapidly progressive symptoms. On physical examination at our hospital, her wrist was swollen and the overlying skin was reddish and taut (Fig. 1a). All values of the laboratory analysis were normal except for the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, which was slightly elevated at 1.1 mg dL (normal range,  mg dL). Her leukocyte count was also elevated at 12 810 mm (normal range, 2900-9100 mm). The differential revealed neutrophils, 76.1 % (normal range, 46 %-62 %); lymphocytes, 17.3 % (normal range, 30 %-40 %); monocytes, 5.5 % (normal range, 4 %-7 %); eosinophils, 0.8 % (normal range, 3 %-5 %); and basophils, 0.3 % (normal range,  %).
Plain radiography revealed an ill-defined osteolytic lesion in the radius (Fig. 1b). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the lesion had homogenous low-signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images; the involved area was larger than the osteolytic area seen on plain radiography. Within the area of high signal intensity, an elliptical line of low signal intensity was observed. Inside this ellipse, a rim of high signal intensity was noted; this rim also had high signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging, consistent with the ""penumbra sign"", characteristic of subacute osteomyelitis (Grey et al., 1998). The presence of a fluid collection in the soft tissue anterior to the distal radius, with low signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging and high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging, suggested an abscess (Fig. 1c-e). The diagnosis based on imaging findings was osteomyelitis. However, secondary infection of a malignant bone tumor of Ewing's sarcoma was on our differential diagnosis.
A needle biopsy specimen was obtained from the radius underlying the area of swelling, and pathologic examination excluded the presence of a neoplastic lesion. The diagnosis, based on her symptoms and the elevated inflammatory markers, was osteomyelitis of the radius. While waiting for pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis, we administered intravenous ceftriaxone, 1 g daily, for nonspecific myelitis.
Culture of the fluid collection overlying the radius revealed Salmonella, but blood culture failed to grow any bacteria. Unfortunately, the species of Salmonella was not determined because the reported diagnosis was not enteritis. Histologic examination of the needle biopsy specimen showed several types of inflammatory cells: aggregates of neutrophils and plasmacytes. The histologic diagnosis was infection, not neoplasm, and the final diagnosis was Salmonella osteomyelitis. The microbiological susceptibility panel was available on the fifth day of antibiotic therapy (Table 1). The patient was continued on intravenous ceftriaxone, but the dose was increased to 2 g daily for 6 weeks, until she reached 35 weeks' gestation.
We continued to observe the patient closely, to be sure that her clinical course continued to follow a typical trajectory of infection and that we did not miss sampling any neoplastic tissue in the bone. The skin overlying the lesion became ulcerated at the site of the needle biopsy tract, and whitish pus was drained. Culture of the pus revealed Salmonella. The soft tissue swelling promptly resolved after the initiation of antibiotic therapy. One week after starting antibiotic treatment, the leukocyte count normalized to 6540 mm (neutrophils, 65.0 %; lymphocytes, 27.1 %; monocytes, 6.4 %; eosinophils, 1.1 %; basophils, 1.0 %). The C-reactive protein level decreased to a slightly elevated value of 0.4 mg dL. On initial assessment, we thought that surgical curettage and drainage might be required. However, we decided not to perform surgery because of her clinical and laboratory improvement. We continued intravenous ceftriaxone and avoided oral quinolone medication to prevent fetotoxicity. We followed the patient with laboratory analysis, including C-reactive protein, once monthly. By 1 month after finishing the antibiotic course, the patient's C-reactive protein value was normal, at less than 0.1 mg dL.
We were concerned that the infection could spread to the uterus and lead to premature labor, so the patient was seen every 1 to 2 weeks by obstetricians during the treatment period, and the fetus was evaluated by ultrasonography. At 40 weeks' gestation, the patient underwent emergency cesarean delivery for a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern. She was delivered of a male infant weighing 3168 g. The neonate was examined by neonatologists immediately after birth and 1 month later; his course was favorable. The patient's ovarian mass was resected at the time of cesarean delivery and found to be a cystic lesion,  cm, containing hair and adipose tissue. Histologic examination revealed squamous epithelium and skin appendages, leading to the diagnosis of a mature teratoma, or dermoid cyst.
We followed the patient with plain radiography every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for several years. We obtained an MRI once or twice yearly for several years. The osteolytic area became ossified, as seen on plain radiography performed 1 year after treatment (Fig. 2a). At around this time, MRI showed persistent low signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging and high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging, without any abnormal signal indicating edema of the bone marrow. The fluid collection had resolved (Fig. 2b-d). There was no recurrent infection observed 24 months after completing antibiotic therapy (Fig. 2e).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7517663/,5,images/PMC7/PMC751/PMC7517663_01
PMC3561114_01,PMC3561114,Female,49.0,"A 49-year-old woman, born to nonconsanguineous parents in Laos, but who had lived in Canada for the past 30 years, presented in May 2010 with a 1-month history of weight loss, fatigue, cough, and intermittent low-grade fever. Her previous family and personal medical history were unremarkable. She could not recall being in contact with tuberculosis. Given that a 7-day course of levofloxacin treatment for presumed right lung pneumonia did not improve her symptoms, she was subjected to further examinations. An initial bronchoscopy showed friable, bleeding, and irregular mucosa of the right upper lobe entry. Biopsies were not feasible, but Ziehl-Neelsen and auramine stains of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were negative and cytology was normal. A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed atelectasis caused by an 8 x 7 cm irregular mass impacting the right superior lobar bronchus along with multiple mediastinal and hilar adenopathies (Figure 1a).
Since the most probable diagnosis was a neoplastic process, the patient was discharged home to await a scheduled transthoracic biopsy (TTB). However, when a previous BAL culture was found to be positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), she was readmitted to rule out active tuberculosis. Upon presentation, she was afebrile and her vital signs were normal. There was no regional adenopathy, and the physical examination was normal except for reduced vesicular murmur sounds on auscultation over the right lung. The peripheral white blood cell count was 26 x 109/L, with 21 x 109/L neutrophils and 3 x 109/L lymphocytes. The inflammatory syndrome was considered important due to a serum C-reactive protein concentration of 111 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 25 mm/h. The procalcitonin concentration was 19 mug/L. The hemoglobin level was 71 g/L with a mean corpuscular volume of 73 fL, and the platelet count was at 766 x 109/L. Other routine biochemical tests were normal. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed 3 days after admission, using morning sputum, was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. On the fourth day, the patient developed fever with purulent expectorations. While other investigations were being pursued, treatment for post-obstructive pneumonia was initiated with piperacillin-tazobactam.
An endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) revealed purulent secretions and a diminished right superior lobar bronchus caliber. Multiple transbronchial needle aspirations of adenopathies were also performed. Two days later, the patient's condition necessitated her transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), and vancomycin was added. The peripheral white blood cell count was 47 x 109/L and a chest X-ray film showed a new infiltration process affecting the right lower lobe and median lobe with an important pleural effusion. Analysis of the pleural fluid showed an uncomplicated exudative effusion (pH >7.2) with a predominance of lymphocytes. On the fourth day in the ICU, endotracheal intubation and support with amines were required for septic shock. The results of mediastinoscopy biopsies followed by a TTB of the mass lesion were non-diagnostic, showing only extensive fibrosis and unspecific acute and chronic reactive lymphoid infiltrates. Granuloma formation was not observed.
On the eight day in the ICU, the first preliminary report of the initial BAL sample revealed that it was positive for M. colombiense, as shown by analyzing genomic deletions and rRNA 16S gene sequencing (Quebec Public Health Laboratory). As radiologic control had also deteriorated (Figure 1b), the decision to commence treatment on the same day with rifampicin, clarithromycin, and ethambutol was taken. Later sensitivity analysis by broth microdilution revealed that M.colombiense was susceptible to clarithromycin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.25 mg/L. Rifampin's MIC was 4 mg/L and ethambutol's MIC was >16 mg/L. Although ethambutol and rifampin are useful clinically in cases of Mycobacterium avium complex infections, breakpoints for determining susceptibility and resistance have not been established by the Clinical and laboratory standards institute M24-A2 (CLSI M24-A2). HIV tests were repeatedly negative. Two days later, multiple organ failure (MOF) developed. Since the previous mediastinoscopy culture was positive for a multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain (Table 1), vancomycin was stopped and piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to doripenem and tobramycin. On the patient's 27th day in the ICU, administration of anti-Pseudomonas antibiotics was terminated because her clinical condition was stable. However, when 2 tracheal aspirates were found to be positive for susceptible P. aeruginosa (Table 1) and clinical deterioration was again noted, treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin was started. Unfortunately, the patient died from septic shock with MOF on the 34th day in the ICU.
Interestingly, almost every culture performed during the patient's hospitalization was positive for M. colombiense (Table 1). Although cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology was not performed for this patient before her death, samples from the final bronchoscopy grew CMV in fibroblast cell culture many days later (Table 1). The pathologist also identified CMV inclusions in the lungs, mediastinal adenopathies, thyroid gland, pancreas, and adrenal glands (Figure 2a). This observation was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Figure 2b).
Post-mortem examination of the right lung revealed an organizing pneumonia, and the mediastinum contained a lot of adherence, fibrosis, and adenopathies with lymphoid hyperplasia. No granuloma formation was detected in the lungs or in any of the other organs examined. An immunologic investigation performed before the death of our patient revealed normal counts of lymphocyte populations (CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD56+) and normal levels of immunoglobulins. We concluded that a genetic immunological deficit was very unlikely because of the late presentation of symptoms:at the age of 49 years:and the absence of significant family or personal medical history. Instead, we suspected an acquired deficit; thus, we tested for the presence of anti-IFN-gamma autoantibodies in the patient's plasma. The IFN-gamma titer:defined as the dilution of a patient's plasma that inhibits 50% fixation of 125 pg/mL IFN-gamma in a standard IFN-gamma ELISA assay (eBioscience ELISA kit):was positive at 1:53725. Therefore, the final diagnosis was immunodeficiency secondary to the production of autoantibodies against IFN-gamma, which resulted in post-obstructive pneumonia caused by lymphadenitis and disseminated infection of M. colombiense. The clinical course was complicated by the presence of multiresistant P. aeruginosa infection post-EBUS mediastinitis, CMV pneumonitis with dissemination, and finally, susceptible P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia with septic shock and MOF leading to death.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3561114/,3,images/PMC3/PMC356/PMC3561114_01
PMC3114311_02,PMC3114311,Male,23.0,"The first patient was a 23-year-old man with no previous medical history, presenting with ""swelling of the left eye"". He had been involved in a motor vehicle accident 3 months prior, in which he suffered a left forehead laceration. Thereafter, he noticed progressive swelling of the left eye, peri-orbital redness, and some sensation of sinus fullness. He did not show any fever, chills, sweats, or weight loss. He was seen by an internist about 1 month after the accident and was prescribed antibiotic ointment. The patient used the ointment and felt that this was helping, so he continued using it for about a month. With time the eye became progressively more swollen, so he was referred to an ophthalmologist, who prescribed oral antibiotics and requested a head and orbit CT. The CT revealed that the exophthalmos was caused by a retrobulbar lesion. This mass clearly demonstrated rim enhancement after i/v contrast administration and also showed a low-density center. The lesion was located retroorbitally, eroded posteriorly the roof of the orbit and extended into the middle cranial fossa. He was thus referred to neurosurgery. On examination he had significant left periorbital swelling, erythema, chemosis, and mild proptosis as well as a discrete limitation in upward gaze on the left eye, but no cranial nerve palsy.
An MRI study was requested which showed a 2.8 cm x 2.7 cm x 2.1 cm lesion centered within the left retroorbital space, extending into the temporal lobe in the middle cranial fossa and laterally into the infratemporal fossa. There was obvious osseous destruction involving parts of the sphenoid wing. The intraorbital extension caused a mass effect upon the rectus muscles, optic nerve, and globe. There was no intraconal extension. The lesion was T1-isointense, and following the administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast, there was heterogeneous enhancement. There was altered signal intensity in the soft tissues adjacent laterally, in the infratemporal fossa, and the preseptal soft tissues. Of concern was adjacent meningeal enhancement, but there was no abnormal signal identified within the brain parenchyma itself [Figure 1].
The lesion was initially thought to be a possibly chronic aggressive infection, hence the patient was started on antibiotic therapy. The next day, the patient was taken to surgery for exploration, decompression, and planned evacuation. The fresh frozen analysis of the lesion confirmed a polymorphonuclear infiltrate consistent with chronic inflammation and the initial thinking was that this represented an abscess. Tissue was sent off for culture analysis. The lesion was nearly completely removed with no microscopic residual. The patient tolerated the procedure well and the case was concluded without complications. Since the area was considered infected, no attempt at a definite orbital roof reconstruction was made. However, final pathology analysis revealed that the lesion represented a LCH. This prompted us to study the patient with an X-ray survey as well as bone scanning, but both studies failed to demonstrate any other lesions.
The patient had a short hospital stay and was discharged to home on postoperative day #4. After the final diagnosis was established, the patient was brought back and discussed at our interdisciplinary tumor board, which recommended referring him to radiation oncology. He subsequently underwent therapeutic radiotherapy of 26 Gy fractionated into 13 intervals. The therapy was well tolerated. The patient's only complaints were occasional mild headaches, lasting as long as 1 year post-op before resolving completely. The patient also had an initial partial left-sided ptosis but was otherwise in excellent health and without symptoms. Sequential follow-up MRIs showed no recurrent disease up to 24 months post-op. Currently, the patient is not in need of any medications or therapy and will continue to undergo annual surveillance MRIs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3114311/,3,images/PMC3/PMC311/PMC3114311_02
PMC3661435_01,PMC3661435,Female,40.0,"A 40 year old, previously healthy female complained of retro-orbital pressure, recurrent upper eyelid swelling, photophobia, headache and an increasingly protruding left eye of 3 months duration. She had experienced more subtle signs of orbital congestion for approximately a year. Her past medical history was unremarkable, and no extra-orbital manifestations had been reported.
General physical exam was normal without any appreciable skin lesions. Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Her pupils were symmetric, briskly reactive to light, and without relative afferent pupil defect. Evaluation of extraocular movements, slit lamp bimicroscopic examination, and indirect ophthalmoscopy were unremarkable. Intraocular pressures were 16 mm OD and 23 mm OS.
Orbital evaluation confirmed 3 mm of left hypoglobus and 6 mm of axial non-pulsatile proptosis. There was mild non-erythematous edema of the left upper and lower eyelids, increased resistance to retropulsion, but no discreet palpable mass.
Preoperative contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the orbits revealed a minimally enhancing soft tissue mass in the intraconal left orbit. The mass had ill-defined borders and was located primarily inferolaterally, inseparable from the inferior and lateral rectus muscles and extended to the inferior orbital fissure. The optic nerve was separate from the mass but deviated medially. There was no obvious bone involvement (Fig. 1). On MRI, the mass demonstrated isotense signal intensity to muscle on T1-weighted images, markedly increased signal intensity on T2 weighted images and heterogeneous enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1 weighted images with fat saturation.
The patient underwent an inferior-lateral orbitotomy via swinging eyelid incision (Fig. 2), after a fine needle aspiration biopsy revealed ""neoplastic cells of an undetermined origin."" An indistinct purple mass with the consistency of friable mucosa intermixed with stringy mucoid-like material was encountered and dissected in a piecemeal fashion from the orbital fat with pituitary forceps. Histopathological examination of the mass revealed a myxoid lesion around extraocular skeletal muscle. (Fig. 3A) The lesion exhibited a patternless yet focal and fascicular spindle cell neoplasm with short tapering nuclei and indistinct cytoplasm. (Fig. 3B) These cells were distributed in a copious myxoid matrix containing a small number of capillaries. Mild nuclear hyperchromasia was present without any significant pleomorphism and mitotic activity was not easily visualized. The neoplastic cells were immunoreactive to vimentin (Fig. 3C) and negative to CD34, Myo D1, desmin, factor XIIIa, SMA, ER, PR and S-100 protein. Cytogenetic study revealed a ""female karyotype with multiple aberrations in four cells, finding can be seen in mesenchymal neoplasm but nonspecific to further classify the lesion"". The final diagnosis was an atypical myxoid spindle cell neoplasm.
The patient has been followed with serial examinations and MR imaging for 3 years without recurrence (Fig. 4). There was normalization of the clinical examination. MRI demonstrated a small amount of residual T2 signal. The follow-up 18F-FDG PET also demonstrated uptake in the lateral aspect of the left orbit (SUV of 6.7) consistent with residual tumor. There was no evidence of increased remote FDG uptake to suggest metastatic disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3661435/,1,images/PMC3/PMC366/PMC3661435_01
PMC3304179_01,PMC3304179,Male,15.0,"A 15-year-old male patient referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial surgery, presented with a chief complaint of swelling on right lower one-third of the jaw since 2 months, with a history of slowly progressing swelling. The approximately 5 x 4 cm facial swelling extended superiorly from right corner of mouth to 1 cm inferiorly beyond the lower border of the mandible, medially from left para-symphysis region to distally half of the body of the mandible [Figure 1]. Intraoral examination revealed missing right and left mandibular canines, while in the maxilla the right canine and left maxillary second molar were missing with the left maxillary canine in erupting phase, and with rotated left maxillary premolars. Intraoral swelling was present in relation to mandibular anterior teeth [Figure 2]. Based on the history and clinical findings, a provisional diagnosis of dentigerous cyst in relation to right mandibular canine was made. The patient was subjected to the following radiographic examination.
Orthopantomograph revealed multiple unilocular well-defined radiolucencies with sclerotic border in maxilla and mandible [Figure 3]. Mandibular occlusal radiograph [Figure 4] revealed a well-defined radiolucent lesion with a sclerotic border extending from periapical region of lower anteriors extending to the lower border of the mandible in relation to 33 and 43.
The presence of multiple cysts in the jaws, in association with unerupted teeth, raised a suspicion of Gorlin-Goltz's syndrome. The patient was further evaluated for this. Lateral skull view revealed bridging of the sella turcica [Figure 5]. Computed tomographic (CT) images showed multiple cystic lesions in maxilla [Figure 6] and mandible [Figure 7]. Postero-anterior [Figure 8] chest radiograph revealed a bifid third rib in the right side and an unusual finding of dextrocardia. CT images of the brain showed areas of hyperdensities, suggestive of falx cerebri [Figure 9] and tentorial cerebelli [Figure 10] calcification. CT images of spine revealed bifid spine in relation to C6 C7 T1 [Figure 11]. Ultrasonographic images showed the presence of spleen in the right hypochondrium [Figure 12] and liver in the left hypochondrium [Figure 13] with transposition on great vessels [Figure 14]. The dorsum of the patient revealed the presence of sprengel deformity. There were multiple palmer pits [Figure 15] measuring 0.2-0.3 mm in diameter, which were brownish black in color, and were present on the palms of both his hands. Excisional biopsy was done for one of the cysts and was taken for microscopic examination, which revealed a stratified squamous parakeratinized epithelium with palisading pattern of basal cells [Figure 16], suggestive of odontogenic keratocyst. Enucleation was done under local anesthesia followed by chemical cauterization with carnoy's solution since odontogenic keratocyst has high recurrence rate due to the presence of daughter or satellite cysts and highly adherent epithelial layer. The patient was asked to have a regular follow up.
Since the patient fulfilled the three major criteria for multiple odontogenic keratocysts (palmer pits, falx cerebri and tentorial cerebelli calcification) with three minor criteria of bifid rib, spina bifida and sprengel deformity, the final diagnosis was made as Gorlin-Goltz syndrome with situs oppositus (also called situs transversus or situs inversus), which is a congenital condition in which the major visceral organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3304179/,15,images/PMC3/PMC330/PMC3304179_01
PMC4199188_01,PMC4199188,Female,38.0,"The patient is a 38-year-old woman who presented with a tonic-clonic seizure in 2007. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed a T1-hypointense (Figure 1A), T2-hyperintense lesion centered in the right parietal lobe (Figure 1). The lesion showed irregular areas of peripheral enhancement on T1 imaging with gadolinium (Figure 1C and Figure 1D). There was a second area of T2 hyperintensity with diffuse patchy enhancement superior to the main lesion (Figure 1D). Abnormal T2/FLAIR hyperintense signal surrounded both lesions. The patient also underwent MR spectroscopy imaging of the brain and the lesion demonstrated relative reduction in the NAA peak, as well as elevation of the choline, lactate and lipid peaks compared to normal brain parenchyma. A needle biopsy was performed. The patient's seizures continued despite numerous medical therapies and she subsequently underwent a craniotomy in June of 2008 with biopsy. Postoperatively, the patient remained with seizures and was followed with serial imaging studies. On her August 2009 and August 2010 MRI scans, the more superior lesion increased in size. She subsequently sought an evaluation at our brain tumor center. On histologic examination, the lesion consisted of a hypercellular infiltrate effacing the normal brain parenchyma (Figure 2A). At low magnification the lesion was characterized by an intense chronic inflammatory infiltrate in a perivascular distribution (Figure 2B). On higher power the chronic inflammatory infiltrate was composed primarily of plasma cells (Figure 2C). The surrounding tissue contained abundant histiocytes. Within the histiocytes were needle-shaped eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions (Figure 2D). 
Lesional histiocytes were strongly immunoreactive for CD68 (Figure 2E). Immunohistochemical study for CD138 confirmed the plasma cell predominance in the perivascular infiltrates (Figure 2F). Further immunophenotyping of the plasma cell infiltrate revealed immunopositivity for IgA (Figure 2G). Using chromogenic in situ hybridization, the plasma cells were found to be Ig-k-restricted (Figure 2H). To further characterize the nature of the crystals in an objective manner, a mass spectrometry proteomic based approach was performed. Proteomic studies of protein complexes, particularly those containing inmmunoglobulin deposits, have found increasing application in diagnostic surgical pathology. This is currently feasible in small tissue samples, and facilitated by enzymatic digestion, peptide separation by liquid chromatography and subsequent tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Following laser capture microdissection of the lesional tissue, mass spectrometry was performed on the formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue using previously published methods, confirming the presence of kappa-light chain and the IgA constant region (Figure 3). Interestingly, there was especially high signal for the somatically mutated variable domain fragment of the immunoglobulin kappa-light chain. Additional peptide fragments enriched in the lesion included glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and multiple histone fragments which likely represent non-specific findings. GFAP is frequently identified in proteomic analysis of samples from the CNS, and in this instance may have been derived from associated reactive astrocytes. Given their abundance in all cell types, histone fragments are frequently identified in tissue samples from any source. Taken together the final diagnosis was crystal storing histiocytosis in association with an IgA-k secreting plasma cell proliferation. 
The patient had additional workup performed. Her chest, abdominal and pelvic CT scans were unremarkable aside from a right ovarian cyst. A skeletal survey did not demonstrate any lytic lesions. A bone marrow biopsy revealed all normal hematopoietic elements. The patient was then treated with intensity-modified radiotherapy to the parietal lesions to a total dose of 36 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions. Following radiotherapy she was treated with rituximab, 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks, then 375 mg/m2 once a month for 11 months and is currently on an every 3-month dosing regimen. Her brain MRI scans have remained stable over the past 17 months.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4199188/,13,images/PMC4/PMC419/PMC4199188_01
PMC6007999_01,PMC6007999,Female,15.0,"A 15-year-old female, who presented with a oneweek history of weakness and fatigue, was consulted by a family physician. The full blood count showed anaemia with haemoglobin (Hb) 80 g/l (mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) were unknown). The physician suspected iron-deficiency anaemia and prescribed iron medication orally. During the one-month treatment period, haemoglobin increased to 90 g/l with regression of symptoms. Five months after anaemia was diagnosed in the full blood count, the patient was admitted to Children's Oncohematology Department. Upon presentation to the department, clinical symptoms were progressing again for four days, with greater weakness, fatigue, sound in the ears, and nausea. She had not had complaints related to gastrointestinal system disorders; the last menstruations were not abundant and regular; her family history was negative for gastrointestinal malignancies. Moreover, the parents pointed out that the girl was on a diet with a limited amount of meat and with plenty of physical activity. On physical examination, the patient presented with pale skin and mucosa, tachycardia (144 beats per minute), and harsh systolic murmur. There was no respiratory distress, lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain and masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and no melena. The laboratory tests showed severe normocytic hypochromic anaemia (Hb 44 g/l, MCV 76.2 fl, MCH 20.6 pg, MCHC 270 g/l), erythrocytopenia (2.14 x 1012/l), low hematocrit level (16.3%), reticulocytosis (5.13%), and an elevated platelet count (543 x 109/l). The peripheral blood smear revealed no immature cells. Biochemical analysis showed a normal ferritin level (12.38 mkg/l) and normal results of coagulation. Occult blood was positive in the stool. At ultrasound examination, the left subcostal view showed an empty stomach with an unevenly thickened wall (Fig. 1). A closer look revealed a polymorphic tumour with hypoechogenic, nodal architecture (Fig. 2). The tumour emerged from the wall of the antrum and pylorus, and measured 120 x 102 x 86 mm. Gas foci, probably originating from the compressed stomach, were seen inside. The tumour revealed active blood flow (Fig. 3). Lymphadenopathy was observed in the surrounding mesenteric fat. The tumour mass was located adjacent to the pancreas, the spleen, and the left liver lobe. We found neither evidence of invasion of the pancreas nor liver metastasis.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EDG), which was performed under general anaesthesia, showed a massive solid tumour in the gastric antrum and pylorus with ulceration and protrusion into the gastric lumen (Fig. 4). Multiple biopsies of the tumour were obtained. Immunohistochemistry revealed that neoplasm cells were positive for CD10, Bcl6, c-MYC (8q24 translocation) and negative for MUM1, TdT and Bcl2, Ki67 proliferative index higher than 95%. The final diagnosis was atypical Burkitt lymphoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen showed a large mass originating from the gastric wall but not infiltrating the surrounding organs, approximately 13.0 x 5.0 x 11.0 cm, with a pathologic left para-aortic lymph node. The computed tomography (CT) of the chest did not indicate any lymph node involvement or distant metastasis. Bone marrow aspirate and cerebrospinal fluid were negative for lymphoma. Based on the results of the examinations, the patient was graded as a second risk group (R2) since lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were normal 217 U/l. The treatment was started according to the paediatric NHL-BFM 2004 protocol. She went on to receive four chemotherapy blocks. After the second chemotherapy block, a follow-up EGD showed tumour involution and scarification in the gastric wall (Fig. 5).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007999/,3,images/PMC6/PMC600/PMC6007999_01
PMC9063025_01,PMC9063025,Male,72.0,"A 72-year-old male was transferred to our institution presenting temporary dysarthria and consciousness disorder. Diffusion-weighted image (DWI) revealed several small infarctions [Figure 1a] and magnetic resonance angiography showed a decrease of flow signal of the right intracranial arteries [Figure 1b], which was due to partial disappearance of the high cervical portion of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) [Figure 1c]. Furthermore, a three-dimensional computed tomography angiogram (3D-CTA) revealed an elongated styloid process stenosing the nearby ICA [Figure 1d]. The arterial spin labeling study revealed a remarkable decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) [Figure 1e], with mural hematoma around the stenotic ICA on thin slice T1-weighted images. Angiogram examination again revealed severe stenosis of the left ICA [Figures 2a and b] at around the elongated styloid process. The final diagnosis was a case of carotid artery dissection due to the elongated styloid process (Eagle's syndrome).
As the patient's neurological symptoms recovered during the initial assessment, medical treatment was chosen, and the patient was treated conservatively by aspirin (100 mg/body/day). Oral administration of clopidogrel (loading 150 mg/day, maintenance 75 mg/day) and intravenous infusion of argatroban were added later on, as the patient suffered from repeatedly appearing transient neurological deficits with no change in DWI. Systolic blood pressure was also maintained above 160 mmHg to counteract the cerebral hemodynamic stress. CAS was performed 15 days after admission. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and an eight French temporally occlusion balloon catheter (OPTIMO, Tokai Medical Products, Japan) was delivered proximal to the stenotic lesion. A micro-guidewire was passed through the lesion right after balloon inflation. The blood from the distal ICA was flowed out through to the femoral vein. After percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for stenosis, A 6 to 8 mm tapered Carotid WALLSTENT (Boston Scientific, Boston, USA) was placed at the stenotic lesion after PTA [Figure 2c]. MRA 3d-tof improved the signal intensity compared to before CAS [Figure 2d]. Post stenting angiogram showed no distal embolization at the intracranial arteries and postoperative iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography (IMP-SPECT) showed recovered left CBF [Figure 3]. The blood pressure target was decreased to under 120 mmHg just after stent placement to prevent cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, and the patient showed neither hyperperfusion nor ischemic symptoms. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital at a modified Rankin Scale of 2.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9063025/,7,images/PMC9/PMC906/PMC9063025_01

During examination of the nose, we identified a smooth purplish tumor 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm attached to the lateral nasal wall between the inferior and middle turbinates (Fig 1).
A CT Scan showed a nonenhancing 3 cm. tumor in the left nasal cavity located between the inferior and middle turbinates at the level of the uncinate process with medial maxillary wall erosion (Fig 2).
Resection with maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, frontal and ipsilateral sphenoidotomy was performed. Free margins were reported on the surgical specimen. Thirty radiation cycles were applied until a total dose of 55 Gy was achieved.
Microscopic review of the specimen revealed a vascular neoplasia with multiple vessels comprised of endothelial cells with prominent nuclei and atypia (Fig 3). Elongated fusiform nucleus cells with atypia were also observed between the vascular areas (Fig 4). The final diagnosis was an intermediate-grade angiosarcoma.

PMC3995393_01,PMC3995393,Female,61.0,"A 61-year-old Japanese woman presented with induration on the left forearm. The family history was not remarkable. The medical history included bladder cancer diagnosed 10 weeks earlier, which was resected surgically. Inadvertently, the left iliac artery was occluded during the operation. This was treated intraoperatively by common iliac artery bypass and intravenous infusion of 2% calcium chloride into the arm vein to induce vasoconstriction. Postoperatively, no extravasation of the injected preparation was noted on the arm, but a red flare appeared around the area of administration. The red flare gradually led to induration and ulcer formation. The patient was referred to the Department of Dermatology at postoperative week 7 for further management.
Physical examination showed an indurated plaque of 13 x 65 mm with linearly distributed ulcers covered by yellowish-white material, and the entire lesion was surrounded by reddish skin (fig. 1). Laboratory data showed BUN 25.2 mg/dl (normal: 7.0-22.0), serum creatinine 0.97 mg/dl (normal: 0.3-0.8), serum calcium 9.3 mg/dl (normal: 8.0-10.5), serum phosphate 4.4 mg/dl (normal: 4.0-6.0), and high sensitivity-parathyroid hormone 460 pg/ml (normal: 160-520). Cultures were negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungi.
Two skin biopsy samples were obtained from the left forearm. The histopathological findings were similar in the two specimens and included deposition of basophilic amorphous substance in the upper and middle dermis (fig. 2a), but not in the subcutis. The amorphous material was eliminated transepithelially, with partial defect of the epidermis and substitution with crust. There was granulomatous infiltration surrounding the amorphous material with underlying collagen accumulation. Histiocytic infiltrates intermingled with lymphocytes and giant cells among the collagen fibers (fig. 2b). The amorphous substance stained black with von Kossa staining (fig. 2c). Based on the above clinical and histopathological findings, the final diagnosis was calcinosis cutis. The whitish chalky substance disappeared gradually within 1 month, together with healing of the ulcers within 2 months, with scar formation (fig. 3).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3995393/,2,images/PMC3/PMC399/PMC3995393_01

The nodule evolved with progessive growth and ulceration. One month before, the patient presented with hardnodules on his right arm, leg and tight, following an upward path culminating in bulging in the ipsilateral inguinal region (Figure 3). Physical examination, laboratory test and CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed no sistemic involvement. Anti-HIV and anti-HTLV serologies were negative. Skin biopsy revealed diffuse infiltration in the dermis, composed of rounded cells of conspicuous cytoplasm with large pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, sometimes cleaved, which allowed the visualization of one or more irregular nucleoli. Mitoses were easily observed (Figure 4). Immunohistochemistry resulted positive reaction for anti-CD45LCA, anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD30, and negative for anti-CD20, anti-ALK (anaplastic large cell lymphoma kinase), anti-AE1/AE3, anti-Melan-A, anti-CD56, and anti-CD8. 80% of the cells were positive for Ki-67. The final diagnosis was a primary cutaneous ALCL. The patient underwent chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) due to the topography and extent of the lesions, showing improvement.

PMC10408608_01,PMC10408608,Female,30.0,"A 30-year-old woman presented at our institution with a mediastinal mass. She had a history of shortness of breath and chest pain. The physical examination was normal. Further investigations started with blood analysis, which showed low levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular volume and high red cell distribution width. A peripheral blood smear report indicated moderate microcytic hypochromic anemia. A computed tomography (CT)-guided mediastinal core biopsy disclosed primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBL) with a nongerminal center phenotype and lung tissue infiltrate. Immunohistochemistry showed the following target cells: CD20, CD23 (with focal weak positivity), CD30 (present in a subset of cells), BcI2 (with focal positive staining), Bcl6++, and MUM1++. Further analysis included a bone marrow aspiration, which revealed no signs of infiltration or abnormal cells. The final diagnosis was PMLBL located in the anterior mediastinum. The patient received six cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy and 18 sessions of radiotherapy. The only remarkable event was stomatitis, which was promptly treated with an oral doxycycline gargle and fluconazole.
Five months later, she presented at the emergency department with a headache and episodes of vision changes lasting seconds for the past 4 days. A cranial CT scan was performed, which indicated multiple supratentorial lesions [Figure 1]. The patient was then advised to undergo multisequence intravenous contract brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed lesions located in the right frontal and occipital lobes [Figure 2]. There was no evidence of herniation, midline shift, or acute intracranial abnormalities. Moreover, the orbits, paranasal sinuses, and mastoid air cells appeared normal. A positron emission tomography/CT (PET/ CT) scan reported a decrease in the metabolic activity of the anterior mediastinal mass on the right side. Compared to the previous image, it also showed new, intensely metabolically active intracranial lesions that corresponded to the lesions noted in the recent brain CT and MRI. These findings were found to be consistent with disease progression. The Deauville score determined the stage as 5B and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed only mature T-cells and monocytes.
An excisional biopsy was performed through a right frontoparietal mini-craniotomy. During the surgery, a bulging layer of the cortex covered the tumor. The tumor was firm and yellow, with a clear plane identified, and histopathology confirmed the presence of lymphoma cells. The biopsy showed diffuse sheets of large neoplastic cells with round nuclei. These cells exhibited vesicular chromatin and prominent central nucleoli, as well as membrane-bound multiple nucleoli. Mitotic figures were observed [Figure 3].
Immunohistochemistry indicated the presence of large cells with positive staining for CD20, CD30, BCL6, MUM1, and C-MYC (40%) and negative staining for BCL2 and CD23. The Ki67 Proliferative Index was found to be positive in 80% of tumor cells. Based on these findings, the final diagnosis was progressive secondary CNS large B-cell lymphoma. After the diagnosis, the patient underwent salvage chemotherapy MATRIX/RISE for two cycles, followed by an auto-stem cell transplant.
Seven weeks after surgical resection, the patient was observed to be recovering well. The MRI scan indicated that the right frontal lymphomatous lesions had resolved and that there had been a reduction in the size of the other lesions [Figure 4].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10408608/,12,images/PMC1/PMC104/PMC10408608_01
PMC6432829_01,PMC6432829,Male,79.0,"In February 2018, a 79-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency room of Hospital Infanta Cristina, Madrid, Spain because of fever, cough and yellow expectoration, accompanied by alterations in behaviour, dysarthria and unsteady gait. The patient had undergone surgery in 2013 for severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis, and had an aortic valve biological prosthesis inserted. He had chronic liver disease (class B on the Child Pugh score, with portal hypertension), chronic kidney disease stage III, well-controlled diabetes mellitus type II (HbA1c 5.2%) and high blood pressure. He also had colon adenocarcinoma in remission after right hemicolectomy in 2000. On admission, initial tests showed an increase in C-reactive protein, thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia and mild hypertransaminasemia. The cranial CT scan, chest x-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Urine, sputum and blood cultures were drawn and antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone was prescribed. The urine and sputum cultures were negative.
A Gram-negative bacillus was isolated in blood cultures 72 hours later and identified as Bordetella hinzii using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS; Bruker, Germany). In vitro antibacterial susceptibilities were evaluated using the gradient (E-test; bioMerieux, France) strip method. MICs were: cefotaxime, <256 mg/l; imipenem, 2 mg/l; levofloxacin, 1 mg/l; erythromycin, 16 mg/l; minocycline, 1 mg/l; and co-trimoxazole, 0.1 mg/l. The identification was confirmed using molecular techniques based on 16S rDNA sequencing.
Antibiotic therapy was scaled up to meropenem, improving the respiratory and neurological symptoms. However, 7 days later, fever was still present, and persistent bacteraemia due to B. hinzii was detected in a new batch of blood cultures. It was therefore decided to include piperacillin-tazobactam and to expand the study: a chest-abdomen-pelvis CT scan did not show any relevant pathological findings, but a transoesophageal echocardiogram revealed an enlarged image (29x14 mm) in the anterior segment of the aortic prosthesis, which continued in the initial segment of the ascending aorta, suggesting a periaortic abscess within the preserved aortic valve (Fig. 1). A PET-CT scan showed an increase in the pathological metabolism of the periaortic valve prosthesis, consistent with a perivascular infectious pathology (Fig. 2). Given the diagnosis of infective endocarditis caused by B. hinzii in the periaortic prosthetic valve, the patient was sent to the cardiac surgery service of our referral hospital where the prosthetic aortic valve and mitral valve were replaced, and the interatrial septum (where the abscess was observed) resected. Samples of the periprosthetic abscess collected during the operation confirmed the presence of B. hinzii. The final diagnosis was acute endocarditis caused by B. hinzii of the aortic prosthetic valve, a continuing mitral abscess and a septal abscess.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6432829/,2,images/PMC6/PMC643/PMC6432829_01
PMC7452466_01,PMC7452466,Male,60.0,"A 60-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital for evaluation of back pain. His past medical and family history was unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasound showed a hypoechoic mass with clear margins measuring 30 mm in diameter in the pancreatic tail. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass protruding from the pancreatic tail with no dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (Fig. 1). The mass was circumscribed and there was delayed contrast enhancement. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging was performed for further characterization of the lesion; the mass presented as low intensity on T1-weighted imaging and slightly high intensity on T2-weighted imaging (Fig. 2). On the basis of the above findings, we initially suspected a solid pseudopapillary tumor or a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The patient underwent laparoscopic evaluation which revealed that the edge of the tumor was relatively distinct, but strongly adherent to the pancreas (Fig. 3). Subsequently, laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy was performed for radical excision. The operating time was 255 min, and blood loss was minimal. The patient did not have any complications and was discharged 10 days after surgery.
Gross examination of the tumor revealed a circumscribed, gray, and solid mass measuring 30 mm arising from the pancreatic tail. Histology showed an abnormal proliferation of spindle cells, without strong atypia. The tumor infiltrated the pancreatic interlobular connective tissue (Fig. 4). Pathological analysis confirmed that the resection was complete. Immunostaining was negative for s-100, desmin, and c-kit, and positive for beta-catenin and actin-smooth muscle.

PMC8249766_01,PMC8249766,Female,49.0,"A 49-year-old Caucasian woman, an active smoker (15 packs/year) with an otherwise silent past medical history, presented with a dry cough that worsened in the supine position. While the cough resolved with proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, suggesting a gastrointestinal nature of the symptom, the patient also underwent a routine chest radiograph. The imaging showed a nodule with a diameter of 3.5 cm in the right lower lobe. Thus, a chest CT scan was performed, which confirmed the presence of a solid lesion with well-defined margins, mild contrast enhancement, and a diameter of 34 x 26 mm in the anterior basal segment of the inferior right pulmonary lobe. The exam also revealed an enlarged axillary lymph node that was later confirmed to be inflammatory in nature. To further characterize the lesion, a PET-CT scan with an injection of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was done; the images showed mild uptake at the level of the nodule in the right lower lobe (with a maximum SUV of 2.8) (Figures 1, 2), suggesting a possibly benign or locally invasive biological behavior. Fine-needle biopsy for typing of the lesion was attempted but ultimately not performed due to poor compliance of the patient during the CT-guided procedure. Therefore, wedge resection of the right inferior lobe and nodal sampling were performed with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. A frozen section procedure was performed during the operation, which gave unconclusive results. Hence, it was decided not to perform a completion lobectomy but to wait for the final histological results. The tissue specimen analyzed at histology showed richly vascularized intrapulmonary solid proliferation (Figure 3A) that comprised two types of cells: epitheliomorphic and spindle-shaped cells. The former type of cells had large eosinophilic cytoplasm and moderately atypical nuclei (nucleolates) partially dispersed in a loose stroma crossed by ill-defined septa (Figure 3B); the latter cells, also called ""sub-tentacular cells,"" were interposed with moderate infiltrate of lympho-plasma cells (Figure 3C). No necrosis was found in the sections examined, and the mitotic index was <1 mitosis for 10 high-magnification fields (10 HPF, 40X). At immunocytochemistry, all cellular elements showed a strong positive reaction for synaptophysin (Syn) and neuron-specific enolase (Figure 3D), while there were only areas of positivity to the S-100 protein in correspondence of the sub-tentacular elements. The dissected lymph nodes were negative. The final diagnosis was a primary pulmonary paraganglioma. The postoperative course was uneventful, with the thoracic drainage removed on the third postoperative day (POD) and no signs of pneumothorax on the chest radiograph performed afterward. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fourth POD. At the latest checkup, 1 month after the hospital discharge, she showed no sign of relapse on the chest radiograph. After multidisciplinary discussion with the Oncology, Radiology, and Pneumology Departments, it was decided to proceed with radiologic follow-up at 3-month intervals for the first semester with a chest CT scan, then in 6 months for the following year, and later maintain a 1-year radiologic follow-up either with chest radiographs or a CT scan. The main limitation on deciding the timing of the follow-up was the scarcity of available literature on both the treatment and the recurrence rates; however, the available reports seem to suggest an indolent nature of this tumor with an unlikely tendency to recur, which is what informed about our decision on not performing completion of a lobectomy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8249766/,2,images/PMC8/PMC824/PMC8249766_01
PMC5482159_01,PMC5482159,Male,68.0,"A 68-year-old white male presented complaining of tingling in both feet and a ""funny feeling"" in the lower abdomen since 1 year. He reported weakness in his left leg along with balance problems (e.g., stumbling but not falling). The neurological exam revealed mild weakness of the hip flexors bilaterally, left side greater than right, hyperactive patellar and Achilles responses, and bilateral Babinski signs. The thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an extra-axial T2 hyperintense and T1 isointense soft tissue mass at the T5-T7 levels resulting in extrinsic compression of the spinal cord [Figure 1a and b]. The main differential diagnosis based on exam findings and imaging was a meningioma.
The patient was taken to the operation room and a laminectomy was performed at the T4-T8 levels. Excessive epidural fatty tissue with mild vascular elements was encountered and uneventfully removed. The dura was opened but no intradural lesion was present. Histopathology revealed a lipovascular proliferation with fat and myxoid tissue without malignancy [Figure 2a and b]. On gross analysis, the specimen was an aggregate of red-tan soft tissue fragments measuring 4 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm. The final diagnosis was a benign extradural spinal angiolipoma. Postoperatively, the patient had gradual resolution of his neurological symptoms. There was no evidence of recurrence of his symptoms during follow-up visits.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5482159/,2,images/PMC5/PMC548/PMC5482159_01
PMC4034634_01,PMC4034634,Male,14.0,"A South Indian boy aged 14 years, reported to the Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, accompanied by his father with the chief complaint of broken upper front teeth. History revealed trauma 1 month before while playing and there was no loss of consciousness at the time of injury. There was history of bleeding from the teeth after the injury with sensitivity on taking hot and cold substance and pus discharge through the broken incisors 2 weeks later. Health history of the patient was not contributory.
Patient showed bilaterally symmetrical face with competent lips. Intraoral examination revealed permanent dentition with fracture of both maxillary permanent central incisors (Fig. 1) and pus discharge through the open pulp chambers of both centrals. Bilateral class I molar relationship was noted with localized gingivitis in relation to permanent first molars.
Provisional diagnosis of Ellis class IV injury was made as involving maxillary permanent central incisors. Intraoral periapical radiograph taken for maxillary central incisor area showed periapical radiolucency in relation to central incisors, presence of an inverted supernumerary tooth in the periapical area of the right central incisor and the presence of blunderbuss canal for left central incisor (Fig. 2). The final diagnosis was Ellis class IV injury in maxillary permanent centrals and inverted supernumerary tooth in relation to maxillary right central incisor.
Treatment planning included, completion of root canal treatment in maxillary right central incisor (Fig. 3) followed by extraction of the inverted supernumerary tooth under local anesthesia and apexification for maxillary left central incisor. Palatal crevicular incision was placed from maxillary right canine to maxillary left canine and mucoperiosteal flap was raised exposing the bulge of inverted supernumerary tooth present at the apex of maxillary right central incisor. Bone is removed until the crown of the supernumerary tooth is exposed. The crown of the supernumerary tooth was sectioned with a fissure bur and removed as first piece and the root is elevated into the space vacated by the crown and removed (Fig. 4). A portion of the root apex of the maxillary right central incisor had to be sacrificed during the procedure as it was closely related to the root of the supernumerary tooth. After careful debridement, which included complete removal of the remnants, and achieving hemostasis the flap is repositioned and sutured interdentally. Apexification was planned for maxillary left central incisor with Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA, Angelus , Brazil). Maxillary left central incisor was isolated using rubber dam and working length was determined about 16 mm. MTA was mixed in the ratio of 1:1 on a sterile glass slab, placed into the canal and condensed using reverse ends of the paper points. Intraoral Periapical (IOPA) radiograph was taken after appropriate amount of MTA was condensed into the canal (Fig. 5). After 15 minutes interval obturation using gutta-percha points was completed in maxillary left central incisor. After 3 weeks of apexification composite build-up was done (Fig. 6).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4034634/,5,images/PMC4/PMC403/PMC4034634_01
PMC3325750_01,PMC3325750,Female,48.0,"A 48-year-old woman had complained of mild intermittent lower abdominal distending pain, which was sometimes severe, for one year and difficulty in defecating for two days. Then, she went to our emergency room. Because of her underlying disease of end-stage renal disease, only non-enhanced CT was performed for initial evaluation. On CT, there was an 11cm well-demarcated, slightly heterogeneous (Hounsfield unit: 0-44), and round soft-tissue mass in the presacral region. Fat stranding was not visible and grossly the mass tended to displace rather than to invade adjacent soft-tissue structures, such as the rectum and the uterus. However, since the mass was really huge, some fat planes between the mass and the abovementioned structures are still obscure. Sagittal CT reconstruction revealed that the sacrum was intact (Figure 1). Laboratory data did not show any significant finding except for some abnormal data related to chronic renal failure. Fever was not detected. After admission, this mass was evaluated by sonography, on which it was separated from the uterus and bilateral ovaries. It was heterogeneously isoechogenic with posterior acoustic enhancement and a thin hyperechogenic pseudocapsule. Blood flow was not detected in the mass on color Doppler imaging. Owing to the patient's poor renal function, MRI of the lower abdomen was performed only without contrast injection and showed an encapsulated presacral mass, which was isointense on T1WI but heterogeneously hyperintense on T2WI. On fat-suppressed T2WI, there was no signal attenuation in the mass as compared with the images on T2WI. The fat planes on MRI were more clearly identified between the mass and the uterus but still some fat planes were indefinite between the mass and the rectum (Figure 2). Except for this minimally blurred margin near the rectum, this mass was grossly well-demarcated without any soft tissue infiltration toward the skin. After reviewing all the imaging studies in this patient, since the mass was located in the central portion of the pelvic cavity and surrounded by the uterus, bowel loops, and vessels, we chose sonography-guided transrectal needle biopsy as the first invasive procedure for further evaluation. Why we chose the transrectal approach was also because that the mass was almost inseparate from the rectum and that we suspected the mass might be a submucosal tumor of the rectum. Concerning the risk of tumor tract seeding related to a biopsy procedure, we thought the transrectal approach would result in the shortest tract. Afterward, sonography-guided transrectal needle biopsy was conducted and the pathology report favored a mesenchymal tumor with malignant potential. Surgical excision was then carried out and the surgical margin was free from tumor cells. According to the final pathology report, this tumor was composed of epithelioid cells with pale-staining cytoplasm and myxoid or hyalinized stroma. The stroma was stained for alcian blue and was abolished by hyaluronidase predigestion. The arrangement of the tumor cells was in cords, chains or nests (Figure 3). Immunocytochemical stains were positive for Vimentin, S-100, CD99 but negative for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), Desmin, actin, CK5/6, Calretinin, WT-1, Ber-EP4, alpha-inhibin, and CD34. Type IV collagen embraced groups of tumor cells in a nest-like appearance. Thus, the final diagnosis was parachordoma. This diagnosis was primarily on the basis of cytomorphology and the positive results of Vimentin and S-100. The results of the other immunocytochemical stains were also of some value in this diagnosis. This patient did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy and there had been no recurrence for three years.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3325750/,12,images/PMC3/PMC332/PMC3325750_01
PMC5470563_01,PMC5470563,Male,28.0,"A 28-year-old mother gave birth to a male newborn at the 40th week of gestational age, through an uneventful vaginal delivery. The newborn weighted 3040g, and the Apgar score was 9, 10, 10. During the initial post-delivery examination, the neonatologist detected, as the sole alteration, an irregular, asymmetric, and enlarged right testis of a term newborn. This finding was confirmed by an ultrasonographic examination that showed a heterogeneous solid mass in the right testis without retroperitoneal lymph node involvement. Left testis was descended and external genitalia was normal Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and total human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) determination was 97,819 ng/mL (within normal range for gestational age and birth weight) and 31,4 mUI/mL (reference value: < 5 mUI/mL), respectively.
A right inguinal orchiectomy was performed at 21 hours of age. Gross examination of the surgical specimen showed a light-brown colored, round, and solid mass measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. At the cut surface, a solid and firm sharply defined neoplasia replaced most of the testicle parenchyma, displacing the epididymis peripherally. The morphology was characterized by solid areas, and focal cystic structures resembling follicles containing a light basophilic watery substance (Figure 1A, 1C and 1D). These follicular-resembling areas showed multi-stratified clusters of neoplastic cells. The solid areas predominated and showed a lobulated arrangement formed by large cells with light eosinophilic cytoplasm, with rounded hyperchromatic nuclei and visible nucleoli, besides occasional nuclear infolding (Figure 1B). Mitotic and apoptotic cells were frequent. Immunostainings revealed diffuse positivity for vimentin and focal calretinin and inhibin, and negativity for beta-hCG, alpha-fetoprotein and cytokeratins (Figure 2), thus ruling out yolk sac tumor, which was the major differential diagnosis.
The final diagnosis was juvenile granulosa cell tumor of the right testicle. The epididymis and rete testis were not involved but were displaced to the periphery. Neither necrosis nor infiltration of the tunica albuginea, nerves, or vessels was found. Surgical margins were free of neoplasia. The 4-year follow-up showed a healthy child without evidence of any testicular or scrotum complaints.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5470563/,8,images/PMC5/PMC547/PMC5470563_01
PMC7263850_01,PMC7263850,Female,29.0,"A 29-year-old previously healthy Chinese woman incidentally found a right suprarenal mass by abdominal ultrasound on a preemployment examination. The patient denied systemic symptoms, pain, fever, anorexia, and other notable medical history. Physical examination did not reveal any significant abdominal tenderness, lymphadenopathy or other findings. Routine laboratory examinations were normal, including complete blood count, renal function and electrolyte levels. All the hormonal data showed that 24-h urine cortisol and plasma aldosterone to renin ratio were within normal limits, as were catecholamines and ACTH levels. Cortisol post 1 mg dexamethasone was 0.5 mug/dl (normal < 1.8). HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody tests were nonreactive. Abdominal ultrasound showed the presence of a diffusely hypoechoic, homogeneous mass in the region of the right suprarenal area measuring 4.2x2.5 cm. We proceeded with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, and it revealed a well-defined tumor originating from the right adrenal gland that was 3.3x3.4 cm in size; the tumor, exerted pressure on the hepatic vein without evidence of regional adenopathies or infiltration of surrounding tissues. Contrast-enhanced CT showed moderate enhancement with irregular non-enhanced areas within, suggesting malignancy (Figure 1). A positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan with 18F-FDG was performed, which revealed an exclusive and high uptake in the right adrenal tumor lesion.
A right adrenalectomy was scheduled and performed uneventfully. Intraoperatively, we found a solid mass that almost completely replaced the right adrenal gland adherent to the posterior wall of the inferior vena cava (IVC). We explored the IVC and adjacent organs, and no tumor invasion was detected. Tissue margins were negative. Postoperatively her vital signs remained stable and as there were no complications. No adjuvant therapy and other medication was given, and the patient was discharged 2 days after surgery. Currently, she is alive and doing well, without evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis at the 12-month follow-up.
Gross pathological examination showed a well-circumscribed and partially encapsulated solid tumor weighing 37.5 g and measuring 5.5x5x3.2 cm in maximum dimension. The cut surface was nodular and grayish white in color with few mucoidal, hemorrhagic and necrotic areas. The normal adrenal gland was displaced by the tumor and presented at the edge of the tumor (Figure 2). Microscopically, the adrenal gland was compressed, but not invaded by the spindle cell tumor, which was arranged in interlacing fascicles (Figure 3A). Tumor cells were elongated with eosinophilic fibrillary cytoplasm with marked pleomorphism of the nuclei, with up to 8-10 mitoses/10 high power fields (Figure 3B). No infiltrated lymph nodes were found. An immunohistochemical examination showed positive staining for SMA, desmin (Figure 3C), vimentin, and H-caldesmon (Figure 3D), and negative staining for S-100, CD 117, Dog-1, ER and PR. The Ki-67 proliferation index was approximately 40% in the hot spot. Based on these data, the final diagnosis was confirmed as a primary adrenal leiomyosarcoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7263850/,7,images/PMC7/PMC726/PMC7263850_01
PMC4003264_01,PMC4003264,Female,14.0,"The patient is a 14-year-old girl diagnosed with pharyngitis 1 week before admission. She was referred to the Dr Humberto Notti Pediatric Hospital for macroscopic hematuria accompanied by oliguria, with suspicion of nephritic syndrome. On examination, the patient appeared healthy with a body mass index of 22.5 kg/m2, with no fever or edema. Her blood pressure was 110/90 mmHg (normal blood pressure levels for age, height and sex), with dispersed abdominal pain, aching shoulders, and myalgias. Family history was not significant and there was no history of illicit drugs.
Initial laboratory data were as follows: serum creatinine 3.10 mg/dL, urea 50 mg/dL, hemoglobin concentration 10.3 g/dL, and urinalysis with more than 100 red blood cells, some of them dysmorphic without crystals or hyaline cylinders. Negative 24-hour proteinuria was reported. Laboratory data 12 hours after admission into hospital were as follows: serum creatinine 5.7 mg/dL, urea 85 mg/dL, leukocytes 12,500/muL, platelet count 115 x 103/muL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 2.27 mg/dL (227.3 mg/L), ferritin 313 ng/mL (6-70 ng/mL), fibrinogen 476 mg% (200-400 mg%), potassium 3.4 mEq/L, sodium 133 mEq/L, chloride 93 mEq/L, calcium 8.59 mg/dL, acid base balance pH 7.4/PCO2 29.7 mmHg/HCO3 20 mmol/L, lactate dehydrogenase 800 U/L, and decreased glomerular filtration rate 14.4 mL/m/1.73 m2 by Schwartz formula. Chest radiograph with diffuse interstitial infiltrate in both lungs was demonstrated. Renal ultrasound showed increased kidney size with increased renal parenchymal echogenicity consistent with parenchymal disease.
Twenty-four hours after admission, peritoneal dialysis was started. The next day, creatinine and uremia continued to increase. A percutaneous renal biopsy was performed and intravenous steroid pulses at 10 mg/kg/day were begun.
Serology tests demonstrated the presence of positive C-ANCA by indirect immunofluorescence with documented proteinase 3-specific ANCA (PR3-ANCA). P-ANCA and peroxidase-specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (MPO-ANCA) were negative. Rheumatoid factor and C3, C4 complement levels were normal. Anti-DNA antibody titers measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) by immunofluorescence were at normal levels. Viral serology (hepatitis B and C, HIV), and blood and throat cultures were negative. Anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titers were within the normal limits.
Diagnosis of renal involvement was confirmed through biopsy. Microscopic optic study in 20 glomeruli revealed renal parenchyma with less than 50% glomeruli presenting segmental capillary fibrinoid necrosis with neutrophil exudate surrounding glomeruli. Tubule interstitial infiltrate was also shown (Figure 1). Cellular crescent was seen in 20% of the glomeruli (Figure 2). Immunofluorescence with antibodies against IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 was negative for immunoglobulins, and the intensity of immunofluorescence staining was very weak (trace or trace to 1+) for C3. The final diagnosis was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis.
To investigate other organs affected with small vessel vasculitis, nasal cavity and sinuses computer tomography (CT) showed rhinosinusitis signals and inflammatory tissue. Chest CT showed bilateral pleural effusion.
Immunosuppressive therapy was started with three methylprednisolone pulses, following by cyclophosphamide intravenous pulses (each with a dosage of 750 mg/m2 body surface) continued at monthly intervals for 12 months. After 23 days, the patient's renal function recovered. The early normalization of the glomerular filtration rate made plasma exchange in the protocol treatment unnecessary.
Further, the remission treatment consisted of a daily dose of mycophenolate mofetil 750 mg/m2 in two divided doses and oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg for 6 weeks) followed by slow tapering. She was discharged after 5 weeks. Neither symptoms nor signs of vasculitis were seen at the last clinical control.

PMC8364388_01,PMC8364388,Female,36.0,"A 36-year-old female patient who complained of an intermittent nocturnal cough for one week was admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine (Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Linhai, China) on 2019-09-12. She had no history of dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, or fever.
On 2019-09-17, diagnostic chest enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed nodules in the upper lobe of the left lung (Figure 1A). After giving moxifloxacin anti-infection treatment for more than 10 days, her cough improved. The 2019-10-21 review chest CT revealed a tongue segment mass in the left lung, suggestive of malignancy, and a micronodule in the upper lobe of the right lung (Figure 1B). The lung tumor markers in blood were negative. The bronchoscopy was negative. Pulmonary examination revealed clear breath sounds in both lungs and slightly lower breath sounds in the left lower lung. The patient underwent CT guided lung biopsy. No malignant cells were detected by the ThinPrep cytologic test. The cryptococcal capsular antigen measurement, G-test, GM test, and IgG test for Aspergillus fumigatus antibodies were all negative. A positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) scan on 2019-10-30 suggested an infective lesion in the lingual segment of the left lung.
The patient was treated with ceftriaxone needle 2.0 intravenous drip once daily for two weeks but she was still coughing both white sputum and dark red bloody sputum. On 2019-11-10, fever appeared, with the highest body temperature at 39.4  C. She also experienced left-sided chest pain, with chest tightness after activity that was slightly relieved by rest. On 2019-11-11, chest CT showed lesions occupying the space of the upper lobe tongue segment of the left lung, in addition, some inflammation and fibrous foci were also observed in the two lungs with tiny nodules in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung, and some effusion on both sides (Figure 1C). No improvement was observed after the administration of moxifloxacin (0.4 intravenous drip qd) for one week. On 2019-11-17, the patient began coughing purulent yellow sputum. Bronchoalveolar lavage was given and bronchoscopy revealed congestion and edema of the mucosa at the mouth of the left lingual duct, and no obvious active bleeding (Figure 2). The test results of the lavage fluid were as follows: cell classification: total cells, 8660.0 cells/muL; phagocytes, 13%; neutrophils, 85%; lymphocytes, 1%; eosinophils, 1%. Cryptococcal antigen detection, mycobacterial species identification (ChIP method), lavage fluid culture, and fungal culture of the lavage fluid were all negative. Examination of the alveolar lavage fluid by next-generation metagene sequencing reported relative abundances of 83.5% Prevotella spp. and 9.5% Streptococcus spp. Anti-infection treatment of anaerobe incorporation was started by administering imipenemestatin (1.0 g intravenous drip Q8H) combined with clindamycin (0.6 intravenous drip q12h) was started. By 2019-11-23, the patient's body temperature had returned to normal. Enhanced CT of the chest showed obstruction in the upper lobe of the left lung. A lung abscess was considered, with obstructive pneumonia, and there was slight effusion in the thorax on both sides (the left more anterior) (Figure 1D). On 2019-11-28, the patient underwent thoracic surgery and CT-guided left lung abscess puncture by placing a drainage tube, but drainage of the effusion was not effective. On 2019-12-02, she underwent a thoracoscopic left lung abscess incision and drainage together with pleural effusion clearance and pus wall biopsy. Postoperative pathological diagnosis of the left lung indicated fibrocystic mural-like tissue with abscess formation. On 2019-12-20, the patient was prescribed faropenem tablets (0.2 oral thrice daily) as an anti-infective treatment for 10 days. By 2019-12-30, a small amount of bright red bloody liquid appeared and the cough was still frequent with the production of more yellow sputum. On 2020-01-02, a review of chest CT showed the presence of a mass shadow in the upper lobe of the left lung, with visible air and fluid. The right pleural effusion shadow was more absorbed, and the left pleural effusion shadow appeared more anterior (Figure 1E). The patient received meropenem (1 g intravenous drip Q8H) anti-infective treatment.
On 2020-01-08, the patient underwent left upper lobectomy along with lower lung repair. The postoperative pathological assessment showed a poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma occupying the upper lobe of the left lung, consistent with large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, with abscess formation, and reactive hyperplasia of 18 lymph nodes (Figure 3A). Immunohistochemical results were: thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) (-), napsin A (-), p40 (minority +), cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 (-), synaptophysin (syn) (-), cluster of differentiation 56 (CD56) (+), CK (+), p63 (minority +), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) (-), chromogranin A (CGA) (-), Ki-67 (approximately 90% +). Genetic testing revealed no mutations on amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). The PD-L1 level was 20%.
On 2020-02-04, the patient was admitted to the Department of Oncology Surgery (Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Linhai, China) due to a painless palpable mass in the right breast that had been present for two days (Figure 4). Chest CT showed left residual pneumonia with segmental atelectasis (less anterior), left pleural effusion, and small nodules in the right lung (Figure 1F). On 2020-02-05, the patient underwent right breast large segment resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Routine pathology on 2020-02-12 showed poorly differentiated carcinoma of the right breast with extensive hemorrhagic necrosis (considering the high possibility of breast origin) with reactive hyperplasia of sentinel lymph nodes (two stations) (Figure 3B). Immunohistochemical findings were: estrogen receptor (ER)(-), progesterone receptor (PR) (-), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (CerbB-2) (1 +), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) (+), CK (+), vimentin (-), P63 (focal +), TTF-1 (-), syn (-), CGA (-), CD56 (focal +), Ki-67 (90% +), mammaglobin (-), gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15) (scattered weak +), CK7 (+).
Pathology consultation at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University revealed parabronchial large cell carcinoma of the upper left lung, with morphology, hematoma formation, and immunophenotype similar to those of the carcinoma in the right breast. These findings, combined with immunohistochemical results, suggest that lung lesions are caused by metastasis of breast cancer to the lungs. The vasculature showed no tumor thrombus or nerve invasion, and the bronchial margins were negative. Eighteen lymph nodes were examined, all with negative results, and no tumor metastasis was seen.
Immunohistochemical analysis conducted at a second hospital showed strongly positive GATA (3 +), weakly positive ER (-) and PR (1 +), and positive CerbB-2 (2 +), indicative of invasive carcinoma and hematoma formation in the right breast at grade 3, and intraductal carcinoma with no tumor thrombus in the vasculature and negative resection margins. Two sentinel lymph nodes were negative. Further immunohistochemical results were: smooth muscle actin (+), CD10 (+), CD31 foci (+), and ERG (-).
On 2020-03-09, a review of the chest CT showed multiple metastases in both lungs, left residual pneumonia with segmental atelectasis, a little left pleural effusion, and left pleural hypertrophic adhesion (Figure 5A). In a review of the medical history and pathological results on 2020-3-9, the blood beta-hCG reading was 21,136.00 mIU/mL. Complementary breast tumor tissue immunohistochemistry showed hCG (+) (Figure 3C). The final diagnosis was poorly differentiated carcinoma of the right breast (consistent with choriocarcinoma) with reactive hyperplasia of the sentinel lymph nodes (two lymph nodes). Complementary lung tumor tissue immunohistochemistry showed hCG (+). The final diagnosis was poorly differentiated carcinoma of the upper left lung (consistent with choriocarcinoma) with reactive hyperplasia of lymph nodes (18 cases).
On 2020-03-10, Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed 2-deoxy-2-[18F] fluoro-d-glucose uptake in the pulmonary nodules, liver, left kidney, left erector spinae and quadratus psoas, right humerus and ilium, and tubercle of the right frontal lobe and occipital lobe, which suggested the presence of multiple metastases in these areas.
On 2020-3-11, after a discussion with multidisciplinary experts, we considered a diagnosis of choriocarcinoma (stage IV, FIGO score 17), with multiple metastases to the lung, breast, liver, kidney, and bones. The patient was transferred to the gynecology department and underwent curettage on the same day. No intraepithelial lesions or malignant cells were found on the ThinPrep cytologic test. The Cervista ThinPrep cytological test for high-risk HPV DNA was negative, indicating no high-risk HPV infection. The pathology of the uterine cavity showed endometrial tissue with stromal decidualization. Microscopic examination showed round and tubular endometrial glands, several of which were dilated. The epithelial cells of the glands showed evidence of secretion and the stromal cells showed decidual changes. A detailed medical history was taken of the patient's menstrual cycle, indicating cycles of 23-37 days and menstrual periods of five days. There was one miscarriage in 2014, induced labor in 2015 because the fetus had Down's syndrome, and eight oocyte retrievals in 2019 followed by third-generation IVF that was unsuccessful. On 2020-3-12, a lumbar puncture was performed and the beta-hCG in the cerebrospinal fluid was determined to be 114.80 mIU/mL.
On 2020-3-12, line EMA-CO scheme chemotherapy was initiated (VP16 etoposide 0.16 g static drop + MTX methotrexate 0.32 g + ACTD actinomycin 0.5 mg static drop D1 chemotherapy, etoposide 0.16 g static drop + methotrexate 0.16 g + actinomycin 0.5 mg static drop D2 chemotherapy, vindesine 3.2 mg static drop + cyclophosphamide 0.9 g static drop D8 chemotherapy). Intrathecal methotrexate (15 mg) via lumbar puncture was administered on 2020-03-13, -16, and -20th. To reduce methotrexate toxicity, she was given leucovorin 15 mg intramuscular q12h * 4 times from 2020-03-13 to -15. During the treatment, the patient developed 2 degrees of myelosuppression, 1 degree of dermatitis, and right epistaxis after the chemotherapy.
On 2020-04-01, the patient received two cycles of low-dose EP (etoposide 0.16 g static drip + cisplatin 32 mg static drip QW) induction chemotherapy. On 2020-04-20, the EMA-EP regimen (VP16 etoposide 0.16 g static drop + MTX methotrexate 0.16 g static drop + MTX methotrexate 0.32 g static drop + ACTD actinomycin 0.5 mg static drop D1 chemotherapy, etoposide 0.16 g static drop + actinomycin 0.5 mg static drop D2 chemotherapy, etoposide 0.25 g static drop + cisplatin 120 mg static drop D8 chemotherapy) was started for salvage chemotherapy. A total of 10 cycles of the EMA-EP regimen chemotherapy were administered to the patient by 2020-11-04.
By 2020-08-02, the blood beta-hCG was reduced to normal and the general condition was good. The 2020-10-22 review chest CT scan showed that the shadow of the two lung nodules was significantly reduced compared with previous scans, and the shadows of the two lung patches were absorbed (Figure 5B). The 2020-10-24 review head MRI, compared to that on 2020.03.11 (Figure 6A), showed remission of the metastases of the frontal lobe on both sides and of the occipital lobe on the right side compared to that on the anterior lobe (Figure 6B).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8364388/,1,images/PMC8/PMC836/PMC8364388_01

The right submandibular lymph node was palpable and the patient noticed this swelling after the extraction of the third molar one month prior to his visit to our department. The gingivally lesions were red and soft with irregular surfaces, and the palatal swelling had a purple-gray appearance with intact overlying mucosa (Figure 2).
Radiographic examination revealed a moderate bone loss similar to a periodontal disease.
Laboratory test results were normal, so the patient's diagnosis was stated as inflammatory and reactive hyperplastic lesions.
The patient's teeth were extracted. Only 2 maxillary central incisors were preserved for esthetic. Tissues needed for histopathologic evaluation were obtained from the gingivectomy of gingivally proliferative masses and with a full thickness flap from the palatal swelling.
Soft tissue specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks. For standard pathological examination, the sections were prepared with H&E stain.
The slides of both gingival and palatal specimens showed a dense cellular infiltration under the epithelial layer in deeper portions.
The cells were mononuclear which showed pleomorphism with moderately amount of cytoplasm and round to oval nucleus with prominent nucleoli. These cells did not have a characteristic phenotype. Therefore, a series of differential diagnosis such as large cell lymphoma, plasmacytoma, poorly differentiated carcinoma and lymphoblastic leukemia was suggested (Figure 3-4).
For the final diagnosis, a panel of antibodies was applied using the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. The tumor cells were diffusely positive with antibodies against LCA, negative with CD20, CD3 and CD79a and positive with C-kit. Therefore, according to the IHC results in combination with morphological features, the final diagnosis was made as granulocytic sarcoma.
The patient was then referred to the Hematology Department. Bone marrow biopsy and bone marrow aspiration were negative for malignant cells, and the laboratory tests revealed only an increase in the monocyte population.
The treatment protocol was 5 courses of induction chemotherapy with cytarabine, idarubici and doxorubicin and adjuvant whole brain radiotherapy.
During the chemotherapy, the patient had neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Although we tried to manage the complications, the clinical outcome became worse, and the patient died after a heart attack 10 months post diagnosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4142959/,4,images/PMC4/PMC414/PMC4142959_01
PMC6238323_01,PMC6238323,Female,46.0,"A previously healthy 46-year-old woman presented to our department with a 6-month history of mild headache. Intracranial computed tomography (CT) revealed an iso-dense mass without calcification in the anterior area of the third ventricle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated that the tumor (diameter, 14 x 18 x 18 mm) was predominantly isointense on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and homogeneously enhanced to a high degree with gadolinium (Gd) [Figure 1]. The optic chiasma was displaced downwards, and the anterior wall of the third ventricle was deviated. Perilesional edema reaching up to the mesencephalon bilaterally and the internal capsule associated with compression by the tumor mass were clearly observable on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI [Figure 2]. No pituitary insufficiency was evident from laboratory examinations. Preoperative differential diagnoses included intraventricular meningioma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, and chordoid glioma of the third ventricle. To confirm the histological diagnosis, the tumor was resected microsurgically under an interhemispheric translamina terminalis approach to the third ventricle. Intraoperative examination demonstrated that the tumor was firm, rubbery, and nonsuckable, and appeared to be originating from the lamina terminalis with a clear margin between normal structures including the hypothalamus. We achieved gross total resection of the tumor to reduce compression of the optic nerve. Histopathological examination with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the tumor showed a neoplastic tissue comprising eosinophilic epithelioid cells with large nucleoli arranged in small sheets, within mucinous stroma. Sparse lymphocytic infiltrate was present, and no mitosis was detected [Figure 3]. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using antibodies for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (rabbit polyclonal antibody; DAKO; ready to use), CD34 (mouse monoclonal antibody; clone 9BEnd10; DAKO; ready to use), thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1 (mouse monoclonal antibody; clone 8G7G3/1; DAKO; ready to use), and Ki-67 (mouse monoclonal antibody; clone MIB-1; DAKO; ready to use). Most tumor cells showed immunoreactivity for GFAP and CD34 [Figure 4a and b]. In addition, almost all tumor cells appeared strongly positive for TTF-1 [Figure 4c]. The Ki-67 (MIB-1) proliferation-related labeling index was low, at 2.0% [Figure 4d]. With regard to the genetic profile, these tumor cells were immunonegative for R132H-mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1. Taking all these results into account, the final diagnosis was chordoid glioma of the third ventricle in accordance with the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). The postoperative course was uneventful and her headache improved immediately. MRI at 1 year after the initial treatment did not show any residual tumor [Figure 5].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6238323/,8,images/PMC6/PMC623/PMC6238323_01

She had fatigue, weight loss and night sweats. The physical examination revealed absent tactile fremitus, dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds in the lower part of the right side of the thorax. There were crackling rales in the upper part of the right side of the chest in addition to percussion dullness. Enlarged cervical lymph nodes were found; the largest one had a 2 cm diameter. Chest X ray showed a heterogeneous pulmonary and mediastinal opacity associated to a pleural effusion (Figure 1). The complete blood count showed a neutrophilic leukocytosis (2752/ml), thrombocytosis and hypochromic microcytic anemia (hemoglobin at 10 g/l). The C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased at 197mg/l, the sedimentation rate (sed-rate) was at 111, the Lactate Dehydrogenase test (LDH) was at 342 u/l and a hypocalcaemia. The liver and kidney functions tests were normal. The tuberculin skin test and the sputum acid fast bacilli were negative. The chest CT scan showed mediastinal lymphadenopathies, enlarged axillary lymph nodes in addition to pulmonary nodules and alveolar condensation (Figure 2). The abdominal CT scan showed mesenteric lymphadenopathies and a hepatomegaly. The cervical ultrasound found a thyroid nodule and bilateral necrotic cervical lymphadenopathies. The bronchoscopy showed four white lesions at the entrance of the middle lobe bronchus and the right upper lobe bronchus (Figure 3). A pathology study with immunohistochemistry of the biopsies was performed and concluded to an endobronchial localization of Hodgkin's lymphoma (Figure 4). The pathology of the pleural biopsy did not show any specific pattern. The pathology study of cervical lymph node biopsy showed histological patterns of Hodgkin s disease as well as nodular sclerosis. The final diagnosis was stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma (according to the Ann Arbor staging). A pre-treatment assessment was performed, it included HIV serology which was negative, ECG and echocardiogram which did not find any abnormalities, the spirometry was normal. Chemotherapy was indicated, the patient received ABVD protocol (Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine) followed by radiotherapy.

PMC10174458_01,PMC10174458,Male,55.0,"In our case report, a 55-year-old male patient was admitted to our department for recurrent pain in the upper-middle abdomen, which had started 2 years earlier and was aggravated with jaundice for 3 days. The patient complained of pain and discomfort that often radiated to the back and was accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Three days before admission, the pain flared up again, chills and fever were accompanied, and jaundice followed. The patient's prior medical history is as follows. In 2009, he received right posterior sectionectomy for primary liver cancer. In 2015, he received TACE and radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of recurrent HCC. In the meantime he took Sorafenib for one year. (Figure 1). Physical examination showed that the patient had skin and scleral jaundice and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory tests indicated the following: white blood cell count (WBC) 16.47 x 109/L, neutrophil ratio (NEUR) 94.9%; albumin (ALB) 37.1 g/L, total bilirubin (TB) 125.7 mumol/L, direct bilirubin (DB) 72.9 mumol/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 111.5 U/L, alanine transferase (ALT) 355.8 U/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) 289.1 U/L; serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 401.23 ng/ml; prothrombin time (PT) 18.8 s, prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) 1.64; procalcitonin (PCT) 4.77 ng/ml, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) 201.5 pg/ml. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody were negative. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed that the lesion filled the gallbladder cavity. The wall of the lower segment of the common bile duct was thickened. Liver cirrhosis was also revealed. This gallbladder tumor showed punctate enhancement in the hepatic arterial phase and then became less dense than the liver parenchyma in the portal phase (Figure 2). No regional lymph nodes were enlarged.
The preoperative diagnosis was considered gallbladder tumor with acute cholangitis, which was potentially malignant. Therefore, hepatectomy of segment IVb, cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration were planned in this case. Intraoperative exploration revealed extensive intraperitoneal adhesions and gallbladder enlargement with dimensions of 12 cm x 4 cm x 3 cm. The gallbladder was solid and tough, while the liver was soft. Because there was no metastasis to the lymph nodes or peritoneum, we performed a monobloc resection of the gallbladder and hepatic segment IVb, and common biliary duct exploration was also performed. The frozen section of the intraoperative specimen indicated a malignant tumor (gallbladder lumen occupying) and probable metastasis of HCC. Subsequent biliary exploration found several stones in the lower part of the common bile duct. After the stones were removed, the lower part of the common bile duct was observed with a choledochoscope, and no tumor invasion or neoplasm was found. Macroscopically the diseased gallbladder appeared to be filled with white soft tumor tissue, and some tissue had extended along the cystic duct to the common bile duct (Figure 3A). The operative time was 360 min, and blood loss was 200 ml. The postoperative paraffin histopathology and immunohistochemistry showed a moderately differentiated HCC with necrosis (Figure 3B). The final diagnosis was amended to HCC recurrence in gallbladder, choledocholithiasis and acute cholangitis. Antibiotics and hepatoprotective drugs were used in postoperative management, and the patient recovered uneventfully within 10 days.
The follow-up showed that the patient was in good condition and survived more than 40 months with no signs of tumor recurrence. To date, the patient has not taken any targeted drugs and immunotherapy drugs we recommended for treatment after surgery. The patient refused the medication because of the significant side effects of sorafenib at the time of the first relapse.

PMC3861586_01,PMC3861586,Female,59.0,"A 59-year-old female presented on June 25, 2008, with a painless mass in the left breast that had been present for one week and a fever with a temperature of 37.0-37.7oC. The patient exhibited no other symptoms or relevant past or family histories. A physical examination revealed a mobile mass in the left breast measuring 1.8x1.2 cm, with no palpable auxiliary lymph nodes.
Ultrasound revealed a solid and hypoechoic mass measuring 1.7x0.9 cm, which had a clear boundary with hypervascular flow, and the mammography showed an equidensity mass with no areas of calcification. The chest radiography revealed no abnormal observations, and abdominal ultrasound revealed no suspected lesions in the liver or spleen. The complete blood count showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2.9x109/l, a neutrocyte count of 0.2x109/l, hemoglobin levels of 109 g/l and a platelet (PLT) count of 104x109/l.
Since the mass in the patient's breast was considered to be a benign tumor, a lumpectomy had to be performed under local infiltration anesthesia. The patient underwent the lumpectomy on June 10, 2008, despite a relatively low WBC count. According to the frozen section, the patient was diagnosed with breast mucosa-associated B-cell lymphoma. Post-operative pathology revealed that the nuclei of the tumor cells were evidently different in size and shape and scattered among the massive fibrous tissue. At the edge of the tumor, the tumor cells exhibited a streamline alignment (Fig. 1A) and mitotic figures were easily identified. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that markers of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD45RA were positive and those for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), L26 and CD3 were negative, while CD45RO was weakly positive (Fig. 1B). The patient was confirmed with AML-M4E0 by bone marrow aspiration, and the final diagnosis was GS of the breast.
The patient received inducted chemotherapy with the MA regimen (i.v. injection of 6 mg/m2 mitoxantrone days 1-3 plus i.v. injection of 100 mg/m2 cytarabine day 1-3, every 3 weeks) and achieved complete remission.

PMC5525462_01,PMC5525462,Male,16.0,"A 16-year-old boy was admitted to our center from another hospital to start plasmapheresis treatment, with the presumptive diagnosis of acute transverse myelitis. The symptoms started 8 days prior to his admittance in our institution, with sudden onset of severe right arm and chest pain, interpreted as a precordialgia secondary to ventricular arrhythmia, followed by progressive severe quadriparesis and respiratory failure. He was admitted few hours after the onset of symptoms to the regional local hospital and was sent to the Neurology Department at our hospital. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were interpreted as a cevicodorsal acute transverse myelitis. The boy was previously healthy and had no medical history.
On examination, the patient presented flaccid paraplegia, with areflexia of the lower limbs, monoplegia of the right arm, and monoparesis of the left arm 2/5 proximal, 1/5 distal. He exhibited a complete sensory level at D4 and sphincter paralysis. He displayed a port-wine angioma in the right cervicodorsal and chest region [Figure 1]. The patient was already intubated on arrival. The spinal MRI (repeated in our institution for lack of quality of the first one) showed intraspinal tortuous blood vessels in the saggital plane from C5-D2, with no predominant variceal component and many flow voids images in the axial plane, occupying the whole thickness of the cord at the aforementioned levels [Figure 2]. It is noteworthy that the intraspinal signal hyperintensity was well above and below the lesion, making it probably responsible for the upper cervical symptoms, as well as the misdiagnosis of acute transverse myelitis from general practitioners who may lack experience in visualizing such images, in the setting of a poorly performed cervical-only MRI (not displayed in this paper).
The patient had no improvement from the symptoms after a 4-day treatment with plasmapheresis, and was presented to our department, where the final diagnosis was made. We programmed surgery 9 days after arrival prior to obtaining a cervical DSA showing right-sided predominance of arterial feeding pedicles and several tortuous varicosal drain veins [Figure 3].
The patient was treated with a standard microsurgical procedure for spinal AVMs performed by the senior author (FRP) with no prior embolization. He was positioned supine, and C6-D1 bilateral laminectomy was performed. The dura was exposed and incised in the regular cefalocaudal fashion, showing underneath the varicosal draining shunted veins in the dorsal archnopial compartment [Figure 4]. With the use of bipolar cautery and the aid of small-sized transitory aneurismal clips, all the arterial feeders, both right and less predominant left-sided, were ligated and coagulated. Then, dissection proceeded in the usual manner as for any AVM, leaving the ligation of the main venous drainages as the last step before piecemeal removal of the lesion. The lesion was removed completely and surgical bed hemostasis was performed with oxidized cellulose polymer, taking extreme caution not to use cautery in the remaining cord. The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period, showing motor amelioration in the right arm at 1/5. His neurological function continued to improve in the following weeks after the surgery, with the residual capability of moving both upper limbs: 4/5 proximal, 3/5 distal left arm; 3/5 proximal, 2/5 distal right arm. He also showed improved respiratory function, being capable to breathe for his own at first and swallowing soft food afterwards. He was discharged to his local regional hospital 7 weeks after the surgery to continue physiotherapy and medical treatment for intercurrent nosocomial urinary tract infection.
In the subsequent control MRI and angiography, there was absence of lesion and significant lowering of the signal intensity above and below the lesion in the remaining spinal cord [Figure 5].
At the 6-month follow-up after surgery, the patient continued rehabilitating in his home town in an outpatient basis, with both upper extremities improving functional capacity to the extent of being capable of self-feeding and performing daily activities. In the last follow-up 1 year after the surgery, the patient functions in a wheelchair, moves both arms with minor deficits, and can attend school.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5525462/,9,images/PMC5/PMC552/PMC5525462_01
PMC5996647_01,PMC5996647,Male,43.0,"A 43-year-old male reported with a swelling in the lower jaw of 8 months' duration, in the mandibular symphysis region with no pain, trismus, or paresthesia associated with the swelling [Figure 1]. Examination revealed an ulcerated erythematous mass arising from the lower anterior alveolar region from canine to canine and obliterating the labial vestibule. The mass was hard in consistency, nontender, and seemed fixed to the mandible. Tongue movements were normal and the floor of the mouth was uninvolved. No regional lymphadenopathy was present. Metastasis was evaluated by ultrasonogram and computed tomography (CT) with negative results.
The mandibular basal bone appeared intact on orthopantomogram.
CT images revealed a well-circumscribed hypointense area of 3.3 cm x 3.3 cm x 2.9 cm in the symphysis region extending from the labial cortex into the soft tissue. Within this, patchy hyperintense areas were noted. There was thinning of the labial cortex with evidence of minimal cortical involvement in the symphysis region [Figure 2].
Taking into consideration the radiological appearance of intact basal bone and the low-grade nature confirmed histologically (incisional biopsy), plan was made for a marginal resection. Intraoperatively, the mass was well demarcated and firm in consistency. The labial alveolar bone was minimally invaded by the tumor. The cortical bone that bordered the lesion was clinically intact. Adequate clearance of 2.5 cm of bony and soft-tissue margin was given [Figure 3]. Postoperative histopathological evaluation revealed that the bony and soft-tissue margins were free of tumor cells. No complication has been reported in the 24-month follow-up. No additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy was given.
Biopsy specimen consisted of lobules of chondrocytes separated by thin fibromyxoid stroma. The chondrocytes show varying degrees of differentiation with areas of malignant cartilage production. Cords of tumor cells, mostly spindle shaped, were seen infiltrating the stroma. The cells in some areas showed atypia with hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitotic figures were identified easily [Figure 4]. The final diagnosis was given as low-grade chondrosarcoma. The surgical margins were free of tumor cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5996647/,4,images/PMC5/PMC599/PMC5996647_01
PMC5175061_01,PMC5175061,Female,30.0,"A 30-year-old female patient admitted to our hospital with sudden hearing loss and tinnitus in the right ear. These complaints had been continuing for three days. The patient was diagnosed as MS 3.5 years ago. Her medical history also included lumbar discopathy. She'd been using beta interferon at a dose of 0.3 mg on alternate days for the treatment of MS for the last 3.5 years. Physical examination of the patient demonstrated intact bilateral tympanic membranes, Weber test was lateralized to the left ear, Rinne test was positive (+/+) in the left, and false negative (+/-) in the right ear. Pure tone audiogram was performed on the patient with the initial diagnosis of sudden hearing loss (Figure 1). The final diagnosis was total hearing loss in the right ear (air conduction/bone conduction: 113/67 dB). The hearing acuity of the left ear was determined to be in normal hearing range (air conduction/bone conduction: 18/12 dB).
After the patient was admitted to our clinic, routine laboratory tests were run. In the laboratory tests; there were no abnormal findings except WBC; 12.7x103/mm3, triglycerides; 34 mg/dL, CK-MB; 25 U/l, UIBC; 366 ug/dL. Contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurology consultation were ordered for the patient. As a result of the consultation, there was no active plaque on the cranial MRI at this time. Accordingly, a new MS attack was not anticipated. To investigate vascular, connective tissue pathologies or infectious etiologies, the results of new laboratory tests were as follows: rheumatoid factor <20, anti-nuclear antibody; negative (-), anti-phospholipid Ig G; negative (-), anti-phospholipid IgM; negative (-). Levels of protein C, protein S, Von Willebrant Factor antigen were in their normal ranges. In Elisa tests, levels of anti-toxoplasma Ig M, anti-CMV Ig M, EBV VCA Ig M, anti-HSV-1 Ig M, anti-HSV-2 Ig M, VDRL-RPR, anti-ds DNA were within their normal ranges. In the light of these findings, classical parenteral treatment protocol of sudden sensorineural hearing loss was prescribed as prednisolone kg/1 mg/day with tapering dose, ranitidine 50 mg/day, pentoxifylline 900 mg/day, low-molecular-weight heparin 0.6 ml/day, acyclovir 2 g/day. Also hyperbaric oxygen therapy was administrated to the patient for 10 days at doses of 2.5 ATA/day.
Pure tone audiogram was performed totally 3 times during hospitalization period. In spite of all our medical treatments, there was no sign of hearing improvement either audiologically or clinically. The patient was discharged with oral treatment and followed up in our outpatient clinic. At the end of our treatment, audiologic examinations were performed. In November, one month after the onset of the disease, there was not any hearing improvement as detected on her pure tone audiogram (Figure 2). Three months later spontaneous recovery was observed on her pure tone audiogram Air/bone conduction 13/7 dB, 30/27 dB were reported for the left, and the right ear, respectively (Figure 3). Additionally, auditory brain response (ABR) test was performed. Prolongation of the absolute latency of 3. and 5. waves, and interpeak latency of 3.-5. waves were found in ABR of the right ear (Table 1). Depending on these findings, the patient's sudden hearing loss of the right ear might be related to MS disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5175061/,3,images/PMC5/PMC517/PMC5175061_01
PMC8776642_01,PMC8776642,Male,14.0,"In 2007, a 14-year-old male underwent excision of an abdominal cutaneous lesion and was diagnosed with abdominal dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (2 cm) with infiltrated surgical margins. The family history of the patient was unremarkable. The disease was limited to the abdomen. Radical resection was performed, with no evidence of residual disease. Further information about the surgery is lacking because the patient underwent diagnosis and treatment in another center. Eight years later, in January 2015, an ultrasound of the chest wall revealed a subcutaneous nodule of almost 5 cm. The lesion was radically excised, and histology revealed a metastasis compatible with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Radiotherapy of the thorax was performed (60 Gy in 30 fractions) and follow-up was negative for one year. In 2016, a CT scan detected the presence of multiple bilateral nodules in the lung and two nodules in the liver, all suspicious for metastases. An 18FDG-PET/CT (18-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography) scan showed areas of increased uptake in the 7th and 8th hepatic lobes and in 3 lung nodules. The patient began imatinib 400 mg/bid, decreased to 600 mg/die because of myelotoxicity. Disease progression was confirmed after 3 cycles and second-line treatment with anthracycline-based chemotherapy was proposed, which the patient refused. In 2017 the patient stopped all antitumor treatments and has since refused further clinical and imaging evaluations.
In August 2019, the patient at the age of 26, was referred to our cancer institute from the Emergency Room of a local hospital following a diagnosis of bone metastases in the left acetabulum, with pathological fracture. A 18FDG-PET/CT scan revealed multiple bone metastases in the hip bone, bilateral ribs and left femur, multiple bilateral lung lesions, multiple liver metastases, muscle metastases, and one lesion in the left kidney suspicious for metastasis ( Figure 1A ). Radiotherapy was performed for the bone pathological fracture (20 Gy).
The recurrence in the thoracic wall was composed of spindle cells characterized by low-grade morphology showing a mitotic rate of <5/10 high-power fields (HPFs) and low-to-moderate cellularity with focal vascular invasion ( Figure 2A ). Following a multidisciplinary evaluation of the case, a biopsy of the hepatic metastasis was performed, revealing the presence of spindle cells arranged in a clearly fascicular pattern ( Figure 2B ). The sections of the tumor were incubated with antibodies and analyzed, revealing the expression of CD34, S100 and p53 at immunohistochemistry (IHC), Ki-67 1% ( Figures 2C   -F ). These features were initially considered as confirmation of metastases form dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.
Next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was performed with the Oncomine Focus Assay on the histologic slides of the 2015 surgery to remove the subcutaneous nodule, highlighting the presence of the TPM4 (exon 7)-NTRK1 (exon 12) fusion gene ( Figure 3 ). Microsatellite instability status (MSI) was also evaluated, but microsatellite stability was confirmed ( Figure 4 ). Given the molecular findings, natural history of the disease and resistance to previous treatment, and after re-evaluation of the histological and immunohistochemical features of the case with an expert pathologist, it was concluded that the final diagnosis was compatible with the new entity of STS, NTRK-rearranged spindle cell neoplasm.
In November 2019, the patient started treatment with larotrectinib provided by Bayer as part of an early access program. Larotrectinib was administered orally in capsules on a continuous 28-day schedule, at a dose of 100 mg twice daily ( Figure 1B ). An 18FDG-PET/CT scan performed 7 days after the start of larotrectinib, considered as a baseline evaluation, showed early tumor shrinkage in both visceral and bone disease. The patient did not experience drug-related toxicity. Subsequent evaluations confirmed tumor regression in disease sites ( Figures 1C, D ). The last follow up of the patient was on October 2021 showing the confirmed metabolic response.

Extraoral examination revealed a soft-to-firm nontender swelling in the left submental and submandibular region [Figure 1]. Left submandibular lymph node was of size 1 cm and nontender on palpation.
On intraoral examination, a localized, smooth, well-defined, nontender swelling approximately of size 4 cm x 2 cm in the floor of the mouth extending from 31 to 38 region was noticed [Figure 2]. Bi-digital palpation of the salivary gland revealed a blood-filled exudate through the ductal opening.
Mandibular occlusal radiograph and computed tomography scan showed flecks of calcifications medial to the left mandibular cortex [Figure 3] that suggested ""chronic sialadenitis secondary to sialolith."" As tumours from floor of the mouth could also obstruct submandibular duct and cause retro-obstructive sialadenitis, ultrasonogram was performed which showed the swelling was of salivary origin. The findings such as hypervascular masses with multifocal calcification and altered echotexture with nodal involvement [Figure 4] and also increased clear cell changes in incisional biopsy were more in favor of malignancy.
Under general anaesthesia, sublingual and submandibular salivary gland along with the associated nodes was excised through transoral approach with midline osteotomy [Figure 5].
The histopathology of the excised specimen revealed mucous cells, intermediate cells, and epidermoid cells with minimal cellular atypia arranged in lobules and sheath forms. Areas of cystic degeneration and stromal hyalinization with clear cell changes in the periphery and invasion into bone and muscle fibers were evident.

PET-CT showed limited skin thickening and soft tissue mass formation with increased metabolism on the outer portion of the left knee, consistent with lymphoma, and increased metabolism in the bilateral inguinal lymph nodes; bone marrow cell morphology showed granular, red, and meganuclear triplet proliferative bone marrow; and the final diagnosis was primary cutaneous ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Six rounds of chemotherapy with the CHOP regimen were administered in June 2022, and the lesions gradually subsided (Figure 7).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10187577/,7,images/PMC1/PMC101/PMC10187577_01
PMC7749957_01,PMC7749957,Male,23.0,"In May 2019, a 23-year-old male was evaluated at our institution for a 1-year history of a painful subcutaneous nodule at the left popliteal fossa. The pain, described as an ""electric shock."" was also irradiated to the lateral surface of the leg. He then underwent ultrasonography, with a first diagnosis of subcutaneous cyst; subsequently, he was submitted in another institution, under local anesthesia, to an attempt for surgical removal by a dermatology specialist; however, the procedure was aborted due to the onset of acute pain. A first MRI [Figure 1a and b] was, therefore, performed in November 2018, depicting a homogeneous lesion of about 12 x 13 mm at the branching point between the left common peroneal and sural nerves. Surprisingly, the patient was not evaluated by a neurosurgeon at that moment. He was instead evaluated by another physician in an outpatient clinic and submitted to 5 mL intra- and perilesional injection of ozone-oxygen mixture. The procedure caused a dramatic, intense, and durable local pain in addition to the previously experienced radiating pain to the lateral leg surface. He was finally referred to our institution, 6 months after the first MRI, for definitive treatment. On admission, the neurological examination showed a slight left foot dorsiflexion deficit, without sensory impairment. An EMG confirmed a mild impairment of motor conduction at the level of the fibula's head. The subcutaneous swelling was suspected for schwannoma of the common peroneal nerve. A second MRI [Figure 1c and d] with contrast medium showed an increase of tumor's dimensions (14 x 16 mm) and, noticeably, also a change in tumor morphology: It had become heterogeneous, with a rim of contrast enhancement and a hypointense central core.
The patient finally underwent surgery under microscopic view, with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. Continuous free-running and stimulus-triggered EMG was used to identify functioning nerves and to localize the safest entry point inside the tumor capsule. Sodium fluorescein 1 mg/kg was intravenously injected by the anesthesiologist, on completion of the induction, as previously described.
A slight curvilinear incision at the level of the lateral and inferior part of the popliteal fossa was performed and, after subcutaneous dissection, we identified an encapsulated lesion between the common peroneal and sural nerves. Since the dissection of the pseudocapsule, a fibrous reaction was noticed, which made it slightly more challenging to identify the tumor capsule and a silent, safe zone without positive electrophysiological responses. Several strong adherences were present, and the consistency of the neoplasm was harder than usual. These factors determined the impossibility to remove the tumor en block; it was instead removed through a gentle piecemeal resection [Figure 2]. Postremoval IOM showed slight impairment in motor nerve response, while the sensory response (sural nerve) was unchanged.
Histological examination [Figure 3] revealed a nerve sheath tumor constituted by well-differentiated Schwann cells, with a thin capsule, loose Antoni B, and compact Antoni A areas, characterized by nuclear palisades consistent with Verocay bodies. Ectatic vessels, cystic-hemorrhagic areas, and foci of acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrates were also identified. The immunohistochemistry showed S100 positivity. The microscopic study highlighted areas of foreign body reaction with hematoxylin and eosin stain (H and E), along with gray-yellowish, uniformly sized microspheres phagocytized by multinucleated giant cells (CD68 immunostained). The final diagnosis was of schwannoma with foreign body reaction.
After surgery, the patient presented worsening of the left foot extension, while local and irradiated pain disappeared. He was then referred to physical therapy: 3-months after surgery, the motor deficit was almost completely regressed. At 12-months follow-up examination, the motor function had completely recovered. The last nerve ultrasonography depicted a discreetly preserved structure, without focal section enlargement.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7749957/,4,images/PMC7/PMC774/PMC7749957_01
PMC3520459_01,PMC3520459,Male,80.0,"An 80-year-old Japanese male (height, 173 cm; weight, 53 kg) was referred to us because of a severe hemorrhagic tendency. He had been a healthy farmer with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group/World Health Organization performance score of 0. However, in the preceding 2 years, he visited the clinic near his residence 13 times and was noted to have leukocytosis with mostly mature neutrophils (white blood cells [WBC]; median 15,500/muL with a range of 10,000/muL to 35,100/muL). The reason for the leukocytosis was unknown. In particular, the WBC counts increased in the year before his admission (median WBC, 25,000/muL; range, 18,000-35,100/ muL). During this period, his hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet counts remained within the normal range. On admission, his left forearm and right lower extremity were tender, tight, and swollen, with superficial bruising and compartment-like symptoms due to extensive soft tissue hemorrhage. There were also ecchymoses on the right arm and the left lower extremity. Over time, this induced swelling of the left dorsum of the foot. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed no significant splenomegaly. The laboratory data were as follows: WBC, 31,900/muL (91.9% neutrophils); Hb, 8.0 g/dL; platelet count, 357,000/muL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 30 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 16 U/L; total protein, 5.8 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 23.1 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.88 mg/ dL; and C-reactive protein, 0.15 mg/dL. The coagulation data were: prothrombin time (international normalized ratio), 0.89 (reference values, 0.84-1.14); activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 69.0 (25.2-40.0) seconds; fibrinogen, 181 (146-380) mg/dL; and D-Dimer, 16.9 (<1.0) mug/mL. The blood coagulation factors and inhibitors were assessed using the APTT and Bethesda methods, respectively, which revealed the following: FVIII, <1.0%; FVIII inhibitor, 190 BU/mL; FIX, 74%; FIX inhibitor, 0%; von Willebrand factor, >201%; and anti-thrombin (AT)-III, 88%. This indicated that the patient had AHA. The patient was negative for antinuclear antibodies (<40). Oral prednisolone (30 mg/day) was started immediately. He was also treated with intravenous activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC; FEIBA ) (Baxter, USA); 3000 U x 2 followed by 5000 U x 10 doses) on a twice-daily schedule. Treatment by aPCC was stopped, but had to be reinstated 2 days later due to rebleeding. Thus, five more doses of aPCC were given. After completing aPCC treatment, recombinant activated factor VIIa (rFVIIa, NovoSeven ) (Novo Nondisk, Denmark) were required on two separate occasions (5 mg x 3 and 1 dose, respectively), when the patient complained of a new subcutaneous hemorrhage on the dorsum of the right hand. The hemorrhaging then stopped. Given the advanced age and impaired glucose tolerance of the patient, coupled with the risk of osteoporosis, we decided not to increase the dose of prednisolone. Instead, the patient was given two doses of rituximab (375 mg/m2/dose). However, 1 month after admission, his coagulation data still showed FVIII levels of <1.0% and anti-FVIII inhibitor levels of 47.8 BU/mL. Two and a half months after admission (and after two more doses of rituximab), the APTT normalized. Bone marrow aspiration was then performed (Figure 1). Thereafter, the FVIII recovered up to 28.0% with a significant decline of anti-FVIII inhibitor levels to 0.1-0.2 BU/mL (Table 1). However, the disease relapsed by week 20, with a FVIII of 6% and anti-FVIII inhibitor levels of 5.3 BU/mL. Two weeks later, these values worsened with 2% and 91.5 BU/mL, respectively. Thus, treatment with prednisolone and rituximab was reinstated for suppressing anti-FVIII inhibitor, along with hydroxyurea (1,000 mg/day) for the control of CNL. Four weeks after reinstitution of treatment at 22nd week with prednisolone, 2 additional doses of rituximab and hydroxyurea, the patient has attained a remission, with full recovery (up to 55%) of FVIII activity and undetectable anti-FVIII inhibitor.
Regarding the patient's persistent leukocytosis, which had been noted for the past 2 years, no causative infectious diseases were found. A granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-producing tumor was ruled out on the basis of a normal plasma G-CSF level of 4.69 (reference values, 10.5-57.5) pg/mL. The neutrophil alkaline phosphatase score of 359% was within the normal range (reference values, 170%-367%). Initially, a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy was deferred due to the hemorrhagic tendency of the patient, which meant that bone marrow findings were not available until the APTT normalized (at 2.5 months after admission). The post-treatment bone marrow smear showed moderately cellular marrow with an myeloid:erythroid ratio of 2.2, myeloblasts at <1.0%, promyelocytes at 1.2%, myelocytes at 8.4%, metamyelocytes at 3.2%, band-form neutrophils at 2.9%, segmented neutrophils at 33.7%, eosinophils at 2.0%, basophils at 0.2%, lymphocytes at 17.6%, monocytes at 5.8%, and plasma cells at 1.5%. Megakaryocyte numbers were slightly increased, but with no atypia. These morphological findings not characteristic of CNL were thought to be due to therapy-related bone marrow suppression (Table 1). Both the peripheral blood and bone marrow showed a normal karyotype of 46, XY (20/20). Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was ruled out because the BCR/ ABL fusion gene was not detected. However, the JAK2 kinase V617F mutation was detected by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. The high allele burden (~80%) was also confirmed by sequencing performed as described previously (data not shown). These clinical and molecular findings led to the exclusion of polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET). The final diagnosis was JAK2 kinase V617F-positive CNL.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3520459/,1,images/PMC3/PMC352/PMC3520459_01
PMC3279320_01,PMC3279320,Male,15.0,"A 15-year old boy with a diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus made from the age of 1 year, was admitted to the hospital reporting one-month history of jaundice. He presented in good general conditions, without any abdominal pain or B symptoms. Physical examination revealed skin and scleral jaundice, no organomegaly or peripheral lymphoadenopathy.
Blood chemical assays showed abnormal liver function tests (GOT 73 UI/l, GPT 144 UI/l, serum alkaline phosphatase 583 UI/l, total bilirubin 10,61 mg/dl), elevated LDH (504 UI/l) and beta2-microglobulin (3,2 mg/l). WBC count and platelets count were within the normal range, whereas a normochromic normocytic anemia was detected (hemoglobin 10.6 g/dl). Serologic tests for HIV, HBV, HCV, CMV, EBV and Toxoplasma were negative. Tumor markers included CA19-9, alpha-Fetoprotein and CEA were within normal ranges.
The CT abdominal scan showed a 4.0x3.2 cm low density tumor in the head of the pancreas, heterogeneously enhancing and obstructing the common bile duct and the main pancreatic duct, many centimetric peripancreatic lymphadenopathies and normal spleen and liver. The patient underwent Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and a stent was placed in the common bile duct, obtaining the improvement of the jaundice. An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was performed and cytological examination revealed a massive infiltration by CD20 and LCA expressing lymphocytes.
The patient was then admitted to our Department of Hematology where he completed a CT scan of the head, neck and chest, showing no significant lymphadenopathies or parenchymal lesions. Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy revealed no lymphoma involvement. Fluorine-18-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) was performed using a hybrid scanner (Philips Gemini GXL) and showed increased glucose metabolism in the known lesion in the head of pancreas (Figure 1A), as well as in one more smaller area in the tail of pancreas and in one lymph node in the hepato-gastric ligament (Figure 1B).
To have a more detailed histopathological diagnosis, an EUS-guided Trucut biopsy was performed and the pathology report documented the complete substitution of pancreatic parenchyma by a large blasts proliferation, expressing CD20, PAX-5, CD10, BCL-6 and MIB-1 proliferative index of 70%, suggestive of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) of the pancreas (Figure 2). Considering the extensive and multifocal pancreatic involvement associated with the involvement of peripancreatic lymph nodes, the final diagnosis was primary pancreatic DLBCL, stage IVEA, age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (I.P.I.) 2 (stage IV, elevated LDH).
Patient was treated with the immunochemotherapy schedule R-CHOP-14 (Rituximab 375 mg/mq, Cyclophoshamide 750 mg/mq, Doxorubicin 50 mg/mq and Vincristin 2 mg on day 1, Prednisone 100 mg/die from day 1 to day 5, Filgrastim from day 9 to 12, repeated every 14 days), with the addition of intrathecal prophylaxis with Methotrexate at each cycle. Blood chemical tests performed after 4 courses showed a normalization of bilirubin levels (total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl) and the CT scan revealed a volumetric reduction of the larger pancreatic mass (3.5 x 2.9 cm). Considering the partial response, the treatment was intensified with a 3 courses multiagent immunochemotherapy Ri-MiCMA (Rituximab 375 mg/mq on day 1, Mitoxantrone 10 mg/mq on day 1, Carboplatin 100 mg/mq from day 1 to day 4, Cytarabine 2 g/mq on day 5, Methylprednisolone 750 mg from day 1 to 5, repeated every 21 - 28 days), with collection of peripheral CD34+ stem cell and followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. The achievement of a complete remission was documented by a 18F-FDG PET/CT scan performed at the end of the treatment. After almost 5 years of follow-up, the patient is in complete remission and in good general condition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3279320/,4,images/PMC3/PMC327/PMC3279320_01
PMC5470561_02,PMC5470561,Male,20.0,"A 20-year-old male patient sought the emergency unit complaining of high-grade fever and chills accompanied by malaise, headache, and weakness during the last 10 days. He referred loss of appetite and consequently 3 kg of weight loss (5% of total body weight). His physical examination was normal, as well as the ophthalmoscopy. Laboratory workup showed normal renal function, glucose determination, electrolytes, hepatic enzymes, liver function tests, protein electrophoresis, and urinalysis. Serology for HIV, hepatitis B and C, toxoplasmosis, EBV, syphilis, leptospirosis, and dengue fever were negative. Rubella and cytomegalovirus serologies showed IgG positive but IgM negative. Tests for antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and rheumatoid factor were also negative. The tuberculin skin test was negative as well as the acid-fast bacilli research in the sputum. The thoracic CT was normal and echodoppler of the lower limbs ruled out the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was normal. Four sets of blood samples, urine, and CSF cultures were negative for bacteria, fungus, and acid-fast bacilli. The patient remained hospitalized presenting a daily temperature of 38.5  C and 39  C and was recorded as a fever of unknown origin (FUO). In this setting, he underwent a transesophageal echodopplercardiogram, which was normal. The determination of a high titer of ferritin was odd, which was interpreted as an inflammatory marker or even the possibility of Still's disease, without other diagnostic criteria. The abdominal ultrasound and CT were normal despite the progressive raising determination of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, APh and gammaGT) and LDHi. Nevertheless he was submitted to a wedge liver biopsy through laparoscopy, which did not detect any abnormality in the abdominal cavity. The histological examination of the liver specimen showed non-specific findings: preserved lobular architecture, with moderate neutrophilic infiltration of portal tract with histiocytes, mild biliary ductal proliferation. The hepatocytes, Kupfer cells, as well as the central veins were also preserved. Bone marrow aspiration resulted in dry tap, which was followed by a bone marrow biopsy, which showed hypoplasia of the all hematopoietic series and focal infiltration by large lymphoid cells, with nuclear pleomorphism, atypia and evident nucleoli.
The patient evolved with lower limb cellulitis and septic shock, and died before the complete diagnostic work up has been completed. Unfortunately the bone marrow biopsy was not prioritized over the other examinations, being undertaken lately in the course of the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by the immunohistochemical report, which showed a profile consistent with ALK+ ALCL: (positive for CD30, ALK, and EMA, and negative for CD20, CD3, CD15, CD43, CD34, CD31, and myeloperoxidase) (Figure 2).
The autopsy revealed generalized lymphadenopathy (lymph nodes measuring up to 2 cm) involving the axillary, mediastinal, abdominal, and lower limb chains, which showed sinusoidal infiltration by large, atypical multinucleated cells (Figure 3).
The lungs, liver, and spleen also showed lymphomatous infiltration (Figure 4). The final diagnosis was ALK+ ALCL and the immediate cause of death was septic shock with massive bilateral pulmonary hemorrhage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5470561/,4,images/PMC5/PMC547/PMC5470561_02
PMC3025878_01,PMC3025878,Female,64.0,"A 64-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with symptoms of breathlessness, dizziness and palpitations. Her past medical history was relevant for hypertensive episodes and for a recent episode of gastroenteritis. Clinical examination of the heart, lungs and abdomen was unremarkable. The ECG showed left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with ST-segment depression and her blood pressure was 180/110 mmHg. Chest X-ray was normal. Troponin I values was in the normal range, Creatine-kinase (CK-MB) was slightly increased (5.5 U/L, normal values 0.0-5.0 U/L) as the leukocyte count and C-reactive protein values (0.6 mg/dL, normal values 0.0-0.5 mg/dL). Echocardiogram showed mild left ventricular (LV) increased wall thickness and hypokinesia of postero-lateral segments, but normal overall systolic function (LVEF 56%). Based on the echocardiographic findings and clinical presentation, the final diagnosis was unclear but sub-acute myocarditis and acute coronary syndrome with subendocardial ischemia were considered the two most likely differential diagnosis. The patient was subsequently referred for a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) study to further evaluate LV function and myocardial tissue characterization. The LV cine images confirmed the abnormalities observed with echocardiography (Additional file 1). Non invasive myocardial tissue characterization with T2-weigthed imaging demonstrated myocardial edema of the postero-lateral segments, whereas the T1-weighted late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images showed diffuse and patchy myocardial enhancement, both consistent with acute non-ischemic myocardial damage (Figure 1A, C). In particular, the CMR features of increased wall thickness, hypokinesia, myocardial edema and patchy pattern of LGE were pathognomonic of acute myocarditis and excluded ischemic heart disease.
In addition, a large incidental mass was identified in the left suprarenal gland, suggesting pheochromocytoma (Figure 1b). Only about 5% of adrenal incidentalomas, usually detected by CT or MRI, prove to be pheochromocytomas after endocrinologic evaluation. On the basis of the clinical presentation and of CMR findings, endocrinologic workup was carried out. Urinary cathecolamines and methanephrines were evaluated and found to be increased: urinary adrenaline 163 ng/24 h (normal values 2-22 ng/24 h), urinary noradrenaline 517 ng/24 h (normal values 12-85 ng/24 h), urinary metanephrine 3387 ng/24 h (normal values 74-297 ng/24 h), urinary normetanephrine 4085 ng/24 h (normal values 105-354 ng/24 h). The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was therefore confirmed and the patient underwent surgical resection of the adrenal mass (Figure 2B). The histological examination (Figure 3) confirmed the diagnosis of secreting pheochromocytoma. The patient was then discharged home. Three months later she underwent a follow-up CMR, showing normalization of wall thickness (Additional file 2), regression of both myocardial edema and LGE (Figure 1B, D).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3025878/,2,images/PMC3/PMC302/PMC3025878_01

His medical history was unremarkable except for post-infectious glomerulonephritis in childhood and flushing episodes that started one year before the hematological evaluation. No pathological findings were reported at physical examination. Previous blood tests revealed a gradual increase of absolute eosinophils count over two years. Recent laboratory examinations showed white blood count (WBC) 8.2x109/L with absolute eosinophil count 2.2x109/L (27%), serum tryptase level 26 ng/mL (normal level <5 ng/mL), normal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and normal liver and renal function.
A bone marrow biopsy detected 60% of cellularity, with myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils and reticulin, and the presence of multifocal clusters of spindle-shaped MCs co-expressing CD25 and CD2 (>15 cells). Karyotype analysis was normal. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the D816V KIT mutation on bone marrow (variant allele frequency - VAF - 0.01%), while the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion transcript was absent.
Overall, these findings were consistent with a diagnosis of SM for the presence of the major criterion (BM MCs infiltrates) and 3 minor criteria (aberrant MCs, KIT D816V mutation, tryptase level >20 ng/mL). Abdominal ultrasound showed normal liver and spleen dimensions and an absence of lymphadenopathy. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan detected osteoporosis (lumbar T score -3.3, lumbar Z-score -2.6, femoral neck T-score -1.5, femoral neck Z-score -0.5).
In the absence of 'B' and 'C' findings, we concluded with an indolent form of SM. The patient did not receive specific therapy other than osteoporosis treatment.
Two years later the patient complained of a worsening of flushing and a recurrent headache. Blood examinations revealed an increase of WBC (13x109/L) with an absolute eosinophil count of 5.1 x 109/L. Suspecting a myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia, a new bone marrow evaluation was performed. The histological analysis confirmed myeloid hyperplasia with a marked increase of eosinophils and 3% of MCs in rare aggregates. Aspirate smear revealed 36% of eosinophils and 6% of MCs. No aberrant MCs were detected with flow cytometry. Cytogenetic analysis showed normal male karyotype and a digital PCR was negative for KIT D816V mutation. Real-time PCR performed on peripheral blood detected the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion transcript and serum tryptase was 20 ng/ml. Thus, the final diagnosis was myeloid neoplasm with PDGFRA rearrangement.
Imatinib 100 mg daily was started, and after 3 months all symptoms resolved and blood tests showed WBC 5.96x109/L with normal eosinophil count (0.09x109/L).
BM analysis revealed the absence of eosinophils and the presence of rare MCs with normal morphology, corresponding to 4% of cellularity at the aspirate smear. Flow cytometry showed a normal MCs phenotype. FIP1L1-PDGFRA and KIT D816V mutations were negative on BM and peripheral blood.
A subsequent BM analysis, performed after 12 months of imatinib treatment, confirmed complete remission of the myeloid neoplasm, absence of aberrant MCs, and negative FIP1L1-PDGFRA and KIT D816V mutations.

On conventional white-light endoscopy, no atrophic changes were seen in the background mucosa, and there was a regular arrangement of collecting venules (RAC). The serological findings indicated the absence of H. pylori infection. A distinct, glossy, reddish, nodular, elevated lesion was detected in the greater curvature of the gastric fundus with a whitish flat elevated area (Figure 1a). The margin of the lesion became clearer after indigo carmine dye spraying, and the lesion was approximately 25 mm in size. (Figure 1b). A clear demarcation line was visualised by magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (M-NBI). When the nodular elevation was observed using M-NBI according to the VS (vessel plus surface) classification system, an absent microvascular pattern plus an irregular microsurface pattern was observed. It was also accompanied by so-called vessels within an epithelial circle (VEC) pattern (Figure 1c). The flat elevated area was classed as a regular microvascular pattern plus a regular microsurface pattern (Figure 1d). Neither light blue crest nor white opaque substance, which are the markers for intestinal phenotype, was detected. Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with gastric phenotype in H. pylori negative was suspected. Histopathological examination of the resected specimens revealed that the background mucosa was histologically negative for H. pylori. The tumour was diagnosed as very well- to well-differentiated adenocarcinoma localised within the mucosa. The nodular part mainly consists of densely proliferating gland ducts of varying sizes and dilated ducts with interstitial oedema. Papillary structures were also seen at the tumour surface (Figure 2a). The tumour tissue consisted of pyloric gland-like tubular ducts.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy revealed no bleeding sources other than the small intestine. Although his symptoms improved without treatment soon after visiting the hospital, he was admitted for further investigation of the cause of anemia and melena in February 2016.
Physical examination was unremarkable. There was no abdominal tenderness. A complete blood count and laboratory data, including tumor marker levels, were within normal limits. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was unremarkable. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) revealed some redness at the ileum. We performed oral and anal DBE in February 2016. Anal DBE showed the narrow opening of an extra lumen in the ileum about 100 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve (Fig. 1). The extra lumen was located on the mesenteric side of the ileum and had a blind end. The biopsy specimens obtained from the ileal duplication showed histologically normal small intestinal tissue. Enteroclysis via DBE using Gastrografin (diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution) (Nihon Schering, Osaka, Japan), a water-soluble iodinated radiopaque contrast medium, showed a 5-cm-long ileal diverticulum-like structure at the mesenteric side of the ileum (Fig. 2). Abdominal CT enteroclysis was performed immediately after DBE enteroclysis in order to confirm the shape and size (Fig. 3). No ectopic gastric mucosa was detected by technetium-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy. The patient was discharged soon after these unremarkable examinations.
The final diagnosis was ileal duplication. We concluded that the abdominal pain, anemia, and melena were caused by the ileal duplication. We will perform surgical excision, including partial resection of the ileum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5028348/,2,images/PMC5/PMC502/PMC5028348_01
PMC4818301_01,PMC4818301,Male,78.0,"A 78-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital for treatment of a hepatic tumor in segment 5, which was identified via abdominal computed tomography (CT), although he had no complaints or symptoms. Four and a half years prior, he had undergone hepatectomy for HCCs (moderately differentiated type) in segments 7 and 5; the operation consisted of segmentectomy 7, wedge resection in segment 5, and cholecystectomy (first operation). The patient had been positive for HCV antibody and negative for HCV-RNA without interferon based therapy.
In laboratory studies, no inflammatory response was observed, the white blood cell count was 5060/mm3, and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 0.16 mg/dL. Additional laboratory results were as follows: total bilirubin, 1.1 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 26 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 21 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase, 266 IU/L; and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, 39 IU/L. Levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP; 5.7 ng/mL) and protein induced by vitamin K absence-2 (PIVKA-II; 13 mAU/mL) were within their normal limits.
Abdominal dynamic CT revealed a 30-mm contrast-enhanced space-occupying lesion (SOL) in segment 5 at an early phase. The lesion presented with washout at a late phase (Fig. 1a, b). CT hepatic arteriography (CTHA) was performed to allow more detailed examination, revealing a hypervascular tumor. Further, CT during arterial portography (CTAP) revealed a perfusion defect in segment 5 (Fig. 1c, d).
The tumor in segment 5 was diagnosed as an HCC recurrence based on radiological findings, as it showed the typical pattern of moderately differentiated HCC. Segmentectomy 5 was therefore performed (a second operation). Histopathological examination revealed inflammatory granulation tissue in a 10-mm yellow-brown nodular lesion. The final diagnosis was IPT of the liver (Fig. 2). Infiltrating plasma cells were positive for immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) on immunohistochemistry. The nontumor area of the specimen showed chronic hepatitis, as indicated by slight lymphocyte permeation around the portal vein.
The subsequent follow-up was conducted using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because a contrast-enhanced CT had caused allergic symptoms after the second operation. One year and 6 months following the second surgery, two new lesions appeared in segment 8. Abdominal contrast-enhanced MRI revealed a tumor (diameter, 16 mm) near the border of segment 8 and a tumor (diameter, 10 mm) below the hepatic dome. Both tumors showed contrast enhancement at the arterial phase and washout at the hepatic cell phase. In a follow-up MRI that was performed 3 months later, the tumor near the border of segment 8 was observed to have grown from 16 to 20 mm, and the tumor below the hepatic dome was observed to have grown from 10 to 17 mm (Fig. 3). Sonazoid-enhanced ultrasonography showed the tumor near the border of segment 8 as a 15-mm hyperechoic lesion at the early vascular phase, as well as a defect lesion at the late Kupffer phase. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT) revealed uptake in the lesion near the border of segment 8, with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 5.0 mC/kg body weight. Further, PET-CT showed uptake in the lesion below the hepatic dome, with an SUVmax of 2.9 mC/kg. The levels of tumor markers AFP and PIVKA-II were within the normal limits during follow-up.
Because HCC recurrence was strongly suspected, liver segmentectomy 8 was performed (a third operation), including the two growing lesions. Histopathological examination determined that both lesions in segment 8 were HCCs (moderately differentiated type). The nontumor area of the specimen showed necrotic inflammatory reactions with bridging fibrosis and bridging necrosis around the portal vein. Currently, at 2 years after the most recent surgery, the patient has shown no recurrence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4818301/,11,images/PMC4/PMC481/PMC4818301_01
PMC7298320_01,PMC7298320,Male,61.0,"A 61-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to abdominal distention. Physical examination demonstrated a huge, hard, tender mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Laboratory data showed inflammation (white blood cells, 15,600/muL; C-reactive protein, 19.1 mg/L), anemia (hemoglobin, 9.8 g/dL), malnutrition (albumin 2.0 g/dL), and an elevated tumor marker (carcinoembryonic antigen 64.1 U/mL). Abdominal computed tomography showed a huge 18-cm mass in the right upper abdomen (Fig. 1). The tumor was located close to surrounding organs such as the duodenum and right kidney. Enlarged surrounding lymph nodes were also noted. There were no distant metastases. The small intestine was dilated due to obstruction by primary tumor. Colonoscopy showed a circumferential type 2 tumor located at the transverse colon (Fig. 2). The scope could not pass through to the oral side of the tumor. Biopsy showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (Fig. 3); RAS status was mutant. Though an ileus tube was inserted, the patient's symptoms did not improve. Finally, locally advanced transverse colon cancer T4b N2a M0 Stage IIIC was diagnosed. Considering the extensive invasion to surrounding organs and difficulties in achieving margin-negative surgery, emergency ileostomy was performed first. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) consisting of a combination of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and leucovorin (FOLFOXIRI) plus bevacizumab, followed by primary tumor resection, was then planned. During NAC, the patient developed grade 2 neutropenia, but the planned course of treatment was completed. After 6 courses of treatment, the primary tumor had shrunk remarkably, from 18.0 cm to 5.0 cm (Fig. 4), and invasion to surrounding organs was not observed. Laparoscopic extended right hemi-colectomy was then performed. First, the ileostomy was closed. Then, EZ access (Hakko-medical, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted through the wound. Five ports, one for the scope and the others for the handling forceps, were used. The procedure was started with the cranial approach for right colectomy, beginning with hepato-colic ligament resection. From the cranial view, the duodenum was not invaded by the primary tumor. After resection of the hepato-colic flexure, the pedicle of the ileocecal artery and vein was grasped by the assistant's forceps. Then, the regional lymph node and vessels were resected. To mobilize the intestine, the mesentery proper was grasped, and the insertion of the mesentery proper was cut. The tumor had not invaded the right kidney. To remove the lesion from the body, the wound was dilated to 5 cm. The tumor was then resected by a suture instrument. A functional end-to-end anastomosis was created. Macroscopic examination showed a 4.8cm x 4.1cm tumor at the transverse colon (Fig. 5a). Histopathologically, the primary tumor and enlarged lymph nodes consisted of fibrous or granuloma-like tissues, and no residual cancer cells were found (pCR) (Fig. 5b). The final diagnosis was transverse colon cancer, ypT0 ypN0 ypStage 0. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged from our hospital on postoperative day 10.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7298320/,4,images/PMC7/PMC729/PMC7298320_01
PMC6476796_01,PMC6476796,Male,60.0,"In 2008, a 60-year-old Japanese male patient was admitted to our hospital for further examination and treatment of an abnormal shadow seen on his chest x-ray during a regular health check-up. An enhanced chest computed tomography scan revealed a 47-mm solid mass with a clear rim in the anterior mediastinum (Fig. 1). Magnetic resonance imaging using intravenous contrast showed iso-intensity and high intensity of the mass on T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. Laboratory findings showed a serum sodium concentration of 119 mEq/L, plasma osmolality of 261 mEq/L, and an elevated plasma antidiuretic hormone level of 6.4/L. A diagnosis of thymoma with SIADH was suspected, and the patient underwent total thymectomy. Based on the microscopic findings with immunohistochemistry, the final diagnosis was thymic neuroblastoma. The histologic pattern confirmed it as a poorly differentiating neuroblastoma based on the classification according to the new World Health Organization system. The tumor had a thin, fibrous capsule and showed no invasion into the surrounding atrophic thymic tissue. His serum sodium levels and blood osmolality quickly returned to normal after surgical excision of the tumor. The patient was provided detailed information about the disease. We recommended adjuvant therapy since the disease is considered malignant with a poor prognosis; however, the patient did not wish to undergo therapy after surgery. Therefore, he was regularly followed up on an outpatient basis with periodic computed tomography scans and laboratory studies including blood analysis and urinalysis once a year. At the 10-year follow-up after surgery, the 70-year-old patient remains free of the disease and is asymptomatic. Witten informed consent was obtained from this patient for the publication of this report.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6476796/,1,images/PMC6/PMC647/PMC6476796_01
PMC4629592_01,PMC4629592,Male,8.0,"Eight years and seven months old male Cocker Spaniel was admitted to the surgery for presence of a thick mucus discharge and changes on the cornea of his left eye. The dog apparently did not have any other health issues. During the clinical examination, the dog was fit, in a good mood and there were no changes in regional lymph nodes. The changes on the left eye were visible: presence of the dried mucus discharge and clingy hair on the upper eyelid and medial canthus.
Due to protrusion of the eye bulb, a pronounced exophthalmos of the left eye was clearly perceptible. The upper lateral quadrant of the cornea was blurry. There were no visible changes in the right eye.
The methods used during the first examination of the eye were: the fluorescein eye stain test, the Schirmer I tear test, measurement of the intraocular pressure and the Jones' test for patency of nasolacrimal duct. As the process progressed, the tumour was sampled for histopathological examination and computed tomography of the skull was also performed in the follow-up examinations.
The intraocular pressure was measured by the Schiotz method, with prior application of anaesthetic (proparacain) to the eye. The solution of fluorescein was used for staining the cornea and testing the patency of the nasolacrimal duct. The computed tomography of the skull was performed by the third-generation device GE (9800-8800), under sedation using Domitor.
The inspection revealed changes on the auxiliary parts of the left eye and presence of dried mucus discharge. Alopecia was not noticed on the lids of the left eye. The third eyelid protruded out of its place covering half of the eye bulb (Fig. 1).
The dog did not react painfully to retropulsion of the eye bulb, which was performed due to its enlargement. There was no counter effect from the bottom of the orbit of the affected eye during the retropulsion. The Schirmer I test results for the right and the left eye were 15 mm and 6 mm, respectively. There was a superficial whitish blur in the upper medial quadrant of the left eye cornea.
The fluorescein stain test was positive, which indicated alteration of the superficial layer of the cornea. The Jones' test was positive for both nasolacrimal ducts. The changes on the iris and on the anterior chamber were not noticed during the ophthalmoscopy. Examination of the posterior segment of the eye and the lens of the left eye was performed after application of the Midriacil 1% drops to the eye. A central Y nuclear sclerosis was noticed in the lens.
There were no anatomic deviations on the fundus, both on the tapetal and non-tapetal part of the retina. A slight swelling of the optic papilla was observable. The mean values of the intraocular pressure of the right eye and the left eye were 22.38 mmHg and 10.24 mmHg, respectively.
The findings of the examination, absence of tears, moderate exophthalmos and slight protrusion of the third eye lid were basis for establishing the working diagnosis of keratoconjunctivitis sicca of the left eye, so further regular follow-ups were advised. The therapy for dry eye (artificial tears) and systemic antibiotic therapy (Cephalexin tabl. 15 mg/kg) were administered to the dog.
A month later, the next examination revealed significant deterioration of the clinical signs on the surface of the cornea and significant enlargement of the eye bulb (Fig. 2).
The position of the left eye bulb indicated upward lateral strabismus. The third eye lid was everted and the conjunctiva was swollen. When performed again, the Jones' test resulted with absence of staining in the left nostril which indicated obstruction of the left nasolacrimal duct.
The owner reported that the dog sniffles discharging a thick secretion from the left nostril and has swallowing problems. Computed tomography of the skull with prior application of sedative Domitor followed the examination of the mouth cavity, which revealed an obvious tumoural mass behind the last upper molar on the left side.
The scan was performed in dorsolateral position (Fig. 3).
The images clearly showed presence of the neoplasia in the region of the medial orbit, osteolysis of the nasal septum and presence of the tumoural mass in the left nasal duct (Fig. 4 and 5).
The excisional biopsy of the neoplasm in the mouth cavity with prior application of xylocain 2% spray was performed after the scan (Fig. 6).
The system therapy including antibiotic and NSAID - antibiotic Cephalexin at a dose of 15 mg/kg p/o and Movalis tablets at a dose of 1.7 mg/kg BW per day - was applied, as the dog obviously suffered from pain. The excised tumour was assessed morpho-pathologically.
The tumoral mass was 3, 4x2, 5x1.8 cm in size and 25g in weight and hard in texture (Fig. 7).
The preparation for histopathological examination was dyed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Histopathological findings showed presence of pleomorphic cells with vesicular nucleus containing one or more nucleoli. The tumour cells produced the chondroid matrix and they were arranged, by their shape and size, in irregular groups which were separated from the surrounding tissue (Fig. 8).
Such histopathological finding indicated a highly differentiated mesenchymal sarcoma of the left eye with destruction of the nasal septum.
Since surgery and radical removal of the neoplasm, as well as application of chemotherapy, were not possible, the dog was given the medication for pain relief and the eye was treated locally with the antibiotic drops (Tobramicin 4x1). Three months after the final diagnosis was established, the dog died.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4629592/,8,images/PMC4/PMC462/PMC4629592_01
PMC5591449_01,PMC5591449,Male,72.0,"A 72-year-old man presented a 2-year history of dyspnea and atrial fibrillation. During the last three months, the patient exhibited occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and two-pillow orthopnea. The patient denied any chest pain, history of myocardial infarction or thoracic trauma in the past. Physical examination revealed moderate elevation of jugular venous pressure and mild hepatomegaly without other gross features of heart failure, and no pericardial knock or rub could be heard. A contrast enhanced angio computerized tomography clearly demonstrated a large spherical mass about 11 x 9 x 4 cm in the anterior pericardium, presenting as a mediastinal tumor and compressing right ventricle inflow tract (Fig. 1A and B). At this time, the origin of the mass was unclear. However, the differential diagnosis included constrictive pericarditis and teratoma. A transthoracic echocardiogram identified the anterior cardiac mass and revealed again the presence of partial compression of the right ventricular free wall (Fig. 1C). The echocardiographic data are given in Table 1. Cardiac catheterization was performed to better elucidate the hemodynamic effect of suspected constrictive pericarditis on right ventricle filling, through observation of dynamic respiratory changes that occur in the heart during cardiac catheterization of the right cardiac side. During the same procedure the coronary angiography was performed and non coronary stenosis was identified.
With evidence of constriction confirmed, the patient underwent pericardiectomy and resection of the mass. Before sternotomy, the central venous pressure was 20 mmHg. Upon gross examination before removal, the mass was noted to extend from the diaphragm to the top of the right atrium, and from the right phrenic nerve to the anterior interventricular groove and right ventricular infundibulum (Fig. 2A). The pericardium was thick. The dissection was started from the anterior surface of the right ventricle toward the mass on the right atrioventricular groove (Fig. 2B). The outer calcified layer of the pericardial mass was a thick layer of calcification surrounded an inner amorphous low density material. This layer was easily opened and the contents of the mass appeared like old coagulated blood (Fig. 2C) which was evacuated with a sterile spoon (Figs. 2 D and 3 A). Then the inferior calcified layer of the pericardial mass which was extremely adherent with the epicardium, was carefully excised, without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, from the origin of the great vessels to the diaphragm and all areas between the right and left phrenic nerves (Fig. 3B). The removed specimens were examined pathologically and were noted to have no evidence of granulomatous inflammation, acute inflammation, or tumor. The removed mass consisted solely of thickened and fibrotic pericardium with nodular calcifications (Fig. 3C) and coagulated blood. Polymerase chain reaction culture of the specimen of pericardium and pericardial fluid revealed no tuberculosis bacilli. The final diagnosis was idiopathic constrictive pericarditis. The patient was discharged 6 days later. Three months later, the clinical status of the patient was significantly improved with normal left ventricular ejection fraction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5591449/,3,images/PMC5/PMC559/PMC5591449_01
PMC6580116_01,PMC6580116,Female,59.0,"A 59-year-old female was referred to our hospital with abnormal nodules in the spleen on abdominal ultrasonography during a routine health screening. Her past medical history included an abscess in the fallopian tube and bilateral ovaries 7 years ago. Baseline laboratory tests, including complete blood count, serum levels of electrolytes (including calcium), renal and liver function tests, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level, and levels of the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a normal-sized spleen with three small hypoechoic nodules of different dimensions. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen confirmed the presence of multiple lesions in the spleen. The three splenic nodules exhibited heterogeneous enhancement with a hypointense signal on T2-weighted images and measured 22, 17, and 9 mm in diameter (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). No other lesions were found in other organs.
The initial differential diagnosis included a fibrous hamartoma and an inflammatory pseudotumor, and a follow-up imaging was planned. An enhanced CT scan performed 4 months later revealed an increase in the diameters of all nodules to 27, 22, and 16 mm. Aberrant 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 2.89 was observed by positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, and the patient finally underwent diagnostic laparoscopic splenectomy.
The 4-trocar technique was used, and ligaments and vessels were dissected using a LigaSure  (Valleylab, Boulder, CO, USA) or by clipping. After full mobilization of the viscus, the splenic artery was exposed until the peripheral parts, and the peripheral artery to the pancreas (pancreatic tail artery) was preserved. The spleen was removed through a small 3-cm opening in the umbilical region. There was no significant bleeding, and the total surgery time was 148 min. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day 5 with adequate oral intake, normal vital signs, and no complaints.
Gross examination revealed that the resected spleen contained poorly demarcated, white nodules (Fig. 3). Histopathological examination showed splenic parenchyma with discrete, round to oval noncaseating granulomas comprising epithelioid granulomas, multinucleated giant cells, and asteroid inclusion bodies (Fig. 4). Postoperatively, CT scan found that no other organs were involved, including the lung, heart, and eyes. The final diagnosis was isolated splenic sarcoidosis. The patient did not receive any systemic treatment. She had been following a steady favorable postoperative course without complications or disease recurrence at 2 years after surgical splenectomy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6580116/,3,images/PMC6/PMC658/PMC6580116_01
PMC8100318_01,PMC8100318,Male,51.0,"A 51-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of a left lung nodule for 1 month. The patient reported a history of cough and hemoptysis 1 month previously, at which time a chest CT scan showed a nodule in the left lung hilum accompanied by calcification ( Figure 1A ), which was initially diagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis; this patient then received anti-tuberculosis treatment and was discharged after improvement. To exclude the possibility of malignancy, the patient underwent a chest CT scan again, and multiple nodules partly accompanied by calcification in the left lung parenchyma, an enlarged high-density mass compared to that on the previous scan in the hilum of the left lung and pleural effusion were observed ( Figures 1B, C ). The contrast-enhanced CT scan and three-dimensional volume rendering image revealed that the large high-density mass in the left hilum invaded the adjacent left pulmonary artery and vein and bronchus of the upper lobe ( Figures 1D-F ). On bronchoscopy, the bronchus mucous membrane of the left upper lobe was swollen and congested, accompanied by mucosal protrusion and lumen stenosis ( Figure 1G ). The patient had a history of diabetes and lost 4 kg of weight in the recent 1 year. There were no other abnormalities reported by the patient in terms of medical history, and the physical examination and laboratory tests were normal. After routine antibiotic treatment for 1 week, the patient progressed and developed symptoms of chest pain and tightness, shortness of breath, and recurring orthopnea, which resulted in respiratory insufficiency. Therefore, left pneumonectomy under cardiopulmonary bypass was performed.
Intraoperative exploration confirmed the CT findings and detected a giant and hard mass in the left lung hilum, and the tumor occluded the adjacent left pulmonary artery and vein lumen. The pathological examination showed that the tumor tissue involved the whole left lung, but there was no evidence of pleural involvement, positive bronchial margins, or local lymph node metastasis ( Figure 1H ). Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the tumor cells were positive for vimentin and Ki67 but negative for AE1/AE3, CD34, S-100, and EMA. The final diagnosis was primary extraskeletal osteosarcoma in the left lung and pulmonary artery. The patient refused to receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy after the operation and was discharged after 1 month of symptomatic and supportive treatment. Four months after the operation, a contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrated tumor recurrence in the left hilum and multiple metastases in the left pleura and somatic muscles, which showed high concentrations of radioactivity on 99mTc-MDP SPECT/CT examination ( Figure 2 ). Then, the patient received a course of systemic chemotherapy with epirubicin, cisplatin, and ifosfamide. Six months after the operation, a contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed enlargement of the recurred local tumor and metastases, especially the lesion at the left hilum, causing compression of the adjacent esophagus ( Figure 3 ).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8100318/,9,images/PMC8/PMC810/PMC8100318_01
PMC7498842_01,PMC7498842,Male,78.0,"A 78-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital in April 2019 complaining of discomfort in his right jaw under the diagnosis of right TMD. Specifically, the patient complained of a swelling-like feeling at the upper and lower right gingiva and constant coldness in his right cheek that he had endured for 1 year before consultation. In addition, he complained of food impaction in the area of the upper right posterior vestibule that caused him discomfort. He has gotten occlusal adjustment of upper right first molar by the previous clinic as it was impinging on the lower gingiva because of over-eruption; however, the patient didn't feel any improvement. His extraoral findings showed facial asymmetry (Fig. 1A-C), and invagination under the zygomatic bone was recognized (Fig. 1A and B). Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) examination showed normal mouth opening (52 mm) but marked deviation to the right side on vertical mandibular movement. Lateral mandibular movements were within the normal range; however, limited movement to the left side was observed. There was no tenderness or pain at the right gingiva, lower lip or mental region upon palpation. Panoramic X-ray showed the right mandibular condyle situated anterior gliding, whereas the left mandibular condyle was contained in the mandibular fossa (Fig. 2).
Past medical history of the patient revealed subtotal resection of a right brain tumor diagnosed as trigeminal schwannoma 9 years prior. In April 2011, the patient was admitted to the emergency department because of complete left hemiplegia and disturbance of consciousness, which gradually progressed until he was in a coma. Examination revealed a gigantic right intracranial trigeminal schwannoma. Because 12 days of medical treatment did not relieve the coma, intracranial tumor resection was performed through a right occipital/suboccipital craniotomy. Although almost 90% of the tumor was resected, the portion attached to the brainstem could not be removed. The patient's condition improved gradually after the operation, and he was discharged in October 2011.
Computed tomography (CT) for the TMJ examination at the first visit showed atrophy of masticatory muscles at the right-side maxillofacial region (Fig. 3A-G). The temporalis muscle (TM), masseter muscle (MM), lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM), medial pterygoid muscle (MPM) and tensor veli palatini muscle (TVP) showed atrophy or absence on the axial view at the level of the mandibular condyle and coronoid process (Fig. 3A), coronal view at the level of the coronoid process (Fig. 3B), axial view at the level of the mandibular foramen (Fig. 3C) and coronal view at the level of anterior of the pterygoid plate (Fig. 3D). The mylohyoid muscle (MHM) was atrophied on the axial view at the level of submandibular space (Fig. 3E) and the coronal view at the level of the pterygoid plate (Fig. 3F). The anterior belly of the digastric muscle (ADM) was also absent from the axial view at the level of submental space (Fig. 3G). An axial view in Fig. 3H shows the bone defect site of the intracranial tumor resection through the right occipital/suboccipital craniotomy (arrowhead).
The final diagnosis was disuse atrophy of masticatory muscles caused by the resection of the right intracranial trigeminal schwannoma. We contacted the attending neurosurgeon and requested a follow-up on the cranial neoplasm by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 9 years after the initial surgery, and confirmed that there was no recurrence of the tumor. Together with the neurosurgeon, we explained to the patient that the oral and maxillofacial symptoms are after-effects of the operation, and we provided oral hygiene instructions and coordinated cleaning of the inside of the oral cavity every 1 month at the primary care dental clinic. Understanding the cause of his medical condition allows the patient to better manage his symptoms, and his quality of life seems to have improved. Currently, the patient has had no recurrence or exacerbation of the former discomfort (swollen right upper and lower gingiva, numbness, and constant cold sensation in the right cheek), actively participates in oral hygiene maintenance, and is able to eat more comfortably than before.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498842/,12,images/PMC7/PMC749/PMC7498842_01
PMC3032668_01,PMC3032668,Male,41.0,"A 41-year-old man was admitted with a 5-day history of intermittent, crampy abdominal pain associated with vomiting and fever. The patient also reported a 2-month history of alternating diarrhea and constipation, abdominal distension and weight loss.
On admission, the patient was normotensive, afebrile and tachycardic. Generalized abdominal tenderness was noted on palpation, with hyperactive bowel sounds and no guarding or rigidity. The patients also presented bilateral lower extremity edema. No petechia, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly were present. The remainder physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory examination including a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver and renal profile were normal. Stool and blood cultures were negative. Multiple air fluid levels were noted on an upright abdominal radiograph. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen (Figure 1, 2) showed ascitis, dilated loops of small bowel with concentric mural tickening, diffuse peritoneal tickening with multiple peritoneal masses, and infiltration of the mesentery and the greater omentum. No lymphadenopathy was seen. Ultrasound-guided paracentesis was performed, and cytologic evaluation of the ascitic fluid showed a cell population with a blastic appearance presenting multilobular nuclei, prominent nucleoli and cytoplasm scant. Immunohistochemistry study revealed positivity for myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD68. The neoplastic cells were negative for T-cell markers (CD3, CD5) and for B-cell markers (CD20, CD79a). During hospital stay, the patient's condition steadily deteriorated, and he developed increasing abdominal girth and ascitis and experienced worsening diarrhea, continued weight loss, abdominal pain, and lower extremity edema. With concern for possible myeloid neoplasm and the presence of subacute intestinal obstruction the patient was scheduled to undergo an exploratory laparotomy. On operation, multiple nodular masses in mesentery and small bowel causing luminal narrowing were seen. Laparotomy findings also included ascitis, and multiple masses on the greater omentum and tickening of the peritoneum. Resection of a clear and evident stenotic segment of small bowel with primary anastomosis and biopsies of the greater omentum and the peritoneum was performed. Samples from ascitic fluid were also taken. The jejunal segment that was resected was 14 cm long and had one tumor that was 4 cm long. Histopathology (Figure 3A) showed a transmural infiltrate, extending to the adjoining mesentery, of poorly differentiated pleomorphic cells with numerous interspersed eosinophils. At higher magnification, the cells had prominent mitotic figures, large irregular nuclei, and scant cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining (Figure 3B) was strongly positive for MPO, lisozyme and Bc12, and negative for CD10 and Cyclin D1. Similar findings were also found in biopsies of the greater omentum and the peritoneum. Since the final diagnosis was GS, the patient was investigated for leukemia. Flow cytometric analysis performed on the ascitic fluid sample showed the expression of CD13, CD33, CD34, CD117 and HLA-DR. A bone marrow aspiration revealed normal cellularity with preserved megakaryocytes, normoblastic erythroid cells, mild myeloid hyperplasia, no increase in blasts and no dysplasia. Molecular analysis of the bone marrow cells using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) identified a CBFbeta-MYH11, ""type A"" fusion transcript with an underlying inversion of chromosome 16, inv(16) (p13;q22). An insertion of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) in exon 14 was found in molecular study of ascitic fluid and intestinal biopsy. According to these data, the diagnoses of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with inv(16) and FLT3-ITD-positive, M2 in the FAB classification, and granulocytic sarcoma in abdomen were made. Induction chemotherapy for AML with idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside (3+7 regime) was started. The clinical course was complicated by catheter-related sepsis. Abdominal symptoms worsened dramatically in 1 week, so he received only one cycle of treatment. After recovery from post-chemotherapy, radiotherapy was administered. A total dose of 22.4 Gy was administered in 14 fractions over 3 weeks (20 days). After radiotherapy, the patient improved considerably, he gained weight and abdominal pain and distension disappeared. CT scan showed absence of ascitis and a clear decrease in the tickenning of small bowel. Two months after diagnosis of GS, the patient is about to restart chemotherapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032668/,3,images/PMC3/PMC303/PMC3032668_01

He reported rhinorrhea, and results of a physical examination revealed septal perforation and a large mass emerging from the left middle turbinate region. A CT showed a solid, well-circumscribed lesion (2.6 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm) that seemed to erode the middle turbinate, obliterate the left middle meatus, extend into the ethmoid air cells, and erode the left lamina papyracea (Fig. 5, Table 1). Although, generally, one would suspect malignancy to be more heterogeneous with less well-defined borders, in this case, radiologists suspected a neoplasm, including adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Middle turbinate cultures showed Escherichia coli and mixed skin flora with white blood cells. With the patient under local anesthesia, the mass was surgically drained and the anterior ethmoid chamber was opened, which revealed a thick yellow-green mucus discharge.

Laboratory values of complete blood count indicated cytopenia (WBC 1.95*109/L  , PLT 77*109/L  , RBC 3.35*1012/L  , HGB 99g/L  ). The final diagnosis was made through skin biopsy and immunochemistry. The epidermis was spared under microscope. A clear Grenz zone was noticed between epidermis and dermis. The extensively infiltrated of lymphocytes can be observed within the entire dermis (Figure 3). High magnification of the lymphocytes in the dermis demonstrated nuclear atypia and immature nuclear chromatin pattern with occasional nucleoli (Figure 4).

He reported that multiple pruritic papules had first been observed 9 years earlier. The papules and plaques gradually grew to approximately 6 cm x 7 cm in size. The tumor was excised at another hospital in 2014, and the diagnosis was ""scar"". Seven months before, multiple nodules had formed on the scalp, and the lesion rapidly invaded the left forehead. Moreover, a mass was also observed on the ipsilateral neck (Figure 1). There were no systemic symptoms or other underlying diseases, including skin disorders. He had no family history of the disease.
Physical examination revealed multiple interfused reddish, tender plaques and nodules, which were 12 cm x 10 cm in size on his scalp (Figure 2A). The lesions had a 1 cm x 1 cm ulceration in the center (Figure 2B). Moreover, there was a skin-colored mass on the ipsilateral neck, which was 3 cm x 3 cm in size. The systematic physical examination showed no abnormalities. Laboratory tests including blood cell counts, urea, and liver function were normal. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was also normal. Magnetic resonance imaging found that the forehead was unevenly thickened and hardened, and there was an irregular soft tissue shadow on the left posterior cervical area that may have been neoplastic lesions (Figure 2C). Incisional biopsies of a nodule and a plaque on the left scalp and an incisional biopsy of the mass on the ipsilateral neck were taken and sent for histopathological examination.
Histologically, the nodule was a classic presentation of TC, whereas the plaque and the mass on the neck presented with some cable-like structures, which looked like sweat glands in the dermis of the lesion and may even have invaded from the dermis to the subcutaneous fat (Figure 3). However, the immunohistochemical results of all the specimens were consistent with trichilemmal differentiation (Figure 4).

An abdominal ultrasound revealed a hypo-echoic area measuring 10 cm in the right kidney with extension into the right renal vein and inferior vena cava. Afterwards, a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan total body was performed, confirming a mass in the right kidney with extension into the right renal vein and inferior vena cava, and further extension into the right atrium.
In addition, the presence of several nodules was highlighted into both lung parenchyma. A cardio ultrasound confirmed the extension into the right atrium, showing the absence of involvement of the tricuspide valve. Retrograde urography confirmed that the right renal pelvis was compressed and distorted, but was unobstructed. The right ureter also was unobstructed. Renal function tests were normal. Urine analysis revealed no microscopic hematuria.
Based on the clinical findings and investigations, a preliminary diagnosis of renal carcinoma of the right kidney was made.
In May 2013,the following surgical procedure has been used:
Right colonic flexure mobilization.
Kocher maneuver with isolation of the infrahepatic IVC and of the renal vein confluence.
Isolation of the hepatic pedicle's elements that are surrounded by a surgical tape.
Section of the falciform, triangular and hepato-gastric ligaments.
Detachment of diaphragmatic peritoneum from the liver as far as the identification of suprahepatic veins and suprahepatic IVC that is surrounded by a surgical tape
Dissection of the IVC from the posterior margin of the liver through a careful section of all the accessory hepatic veins.
Complete overturning toward up and left side of the liver that is now hanged up to the three main suprahepatic veins.
Isolation of the proximal tract of the IVC up to the iliac confluence.
Radical inter-aortocaval (left side tumor) or caval and retro-caval (right side tumor) lymphadenectomy and section of the renal artery.
Suprahepatic IVC clamping.
Clamping of the controlateral renal vein, of the proximal IVC and of the hepatic pedicle
Large cavotomy and renal vein venotomy with enbloc removal of the thrombus, the kidney and of a buttonhole of caval wall close to the renal vein confluence.
Suture of the IVC and declamping of the vessels.
Retro-caval lymphadenectomy.
Sub-costal bilateral incision.
The resected right kidney measured 21 cm x 13 cm x 9 cm (including perirenal adipose tissue), with ureter of 10 cm of length. Near the renal pelvis there was an unicentric rounded mass measuring 12 cm x 4 cm x 2.5 cm that showed, on cut surface, a gray/tan appearance with soft consistency areas, due to the presence of necrosis and hemorrhage. The organ capsule appeared grossly infiltrated by the tumor and there was an extension into the renal vein, with a neoplastic thrombus that measured 22 cm x 2.1 cm x 2.3 cm.
Histologically, the lesion showed diffuse necrotic-hemorrhagic and cystic changes, with a triphasic cellular pattern because of the presence of undifferentiated blastemal cells and cells differentiating toward epithelial and stromal lineages (Fig. 1a and b). The blastemal cells were small, closely packed, and mitotically active rounded or oval cells with scant cytoplasm, and overlapping nuclei containing evenly distributed, slightly coarse chromatin, and small nucleoli.
The epithelial line was made of rosette-like structures and tubular structures. The stromal component was made of spindle cells with elongated nuclei and storiform pattern of growth (immature muscular tissue) and of immature adipose and cartilaginous tissues.
EMA +, Cytokeratin MNF116 clone + (Fig. 2) for the epithelium component;
Vimentin +, Desmin + for the stromal component (Vimentin focally positive in blastemal cells);
NSE +, N-CAM +, s100 +- (neuroepithelium and blastema).
The neoplastic immunophenotype was also triphasic:
The neoplasm infiltrated the renal capsule and perirenal adipose tissue. The renal vein showed an ectatic lumen with thrombotic organized material and several neoplastic foci within.
The adrenal gland was free of neoplastic invasion.
Three of seven intercavoaortic lymph nodes showed metastatic neoplastic repetition.
Thus, the final diagnosis was Wilms Tumor in the adult, teratoide type (sec. Rosai & Ackerman's, Surgical Pathology, 2011), Stade III sec. SIOP (Med Pediatr Oncol 2002;38:79-82) (Fig. 3).
A FISH analysis was made for evaluate the 12p chromosome status, with ratio 12p/centromere12 = 1. The signals disposition and the ratio value were not compatible with the presence of short arm 12 isochromosome.

PMC6010663_01,PMC6010663,Female,34.0,"A 34-year old Polish female was referred to The Danish Center of Interstitial Lung Diseases in 2011 on the suspicion of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). She had dyspnea at exertion and dry cough, and since her teenage years she had nail clubbing. She was a smoker with eight pack years and had a family history of lung disease. There was no suspicion of autoimmune or connective tissue disease or occupational or environmental exposure relevant for interstitial lung diseases.
At referral, her pulmonary function showed a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) of 3.14 L (104%), forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.7 L (107%), FEV1/FVC ratio 84% and a diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 56% of predicted. The distance at a six-minute walk test (6MWT) was 480 m without desaturation. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lungs showed cystic changes and non-specific discrete fibrosis with an upper lobe predominance (Fig. 1). LAM, Langerhans cell histiocytosis and emphysema were suspected. Bronchoscopy with bronchial lavage showed a normal cytological differential count without any CD1-alfa positive cells, and a transbronchial biopsy was non-diagnostic. The patient underwent a surgical lung biopsy, described as chronic lymphocytic inflammation and non-specific fibrosis. Fig. 2 shows the histology of the patient's lung biopsy from lingula in the left lung.
Supplementary immunological tests for LAM and histiocytosis were negative. Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis were discussed as possible diagnosis but no other investigations could support this. The final diagnosis was emphysema, and, as requested by the patient, she was sent back to the referring hospital.
In 2015, the patient was again referred due to progressive dyspnea. Still no specific diagnosis could be made, but she was followed at the specialist unit due to the progressiveness of the lung disease. During the following 18 months, her pulmonary function was slowly declining. In May 2017, FEV1 was 2.11 (72%), FVC 2.39 (71%) and DLCO 21%. 6MWT was 482 m with significant desaturation from 97% to 77%. A new HRCT showed progressive cystic changes in the upper lobes, traction bronchiectasis and ground glass opacities (GGO) (Fig. 3a, b and 3c).
Upon questioning, she told that all male family members had grey hair at age of 40-50 years old but there was no family history of liver cirrhosis or bone marrow failure. Her father died at the age of 58 due to rapid progression of an interstitial lung disease.
Fig. 4a and b shows the fibrotic changes seen in his HRCT-scan.
He did not accept invasive examinations to further clarify the diagnosis. Her grandfather, aunt and uncle also died of lung diseases and they were all reportedly smokers. The patient's family tree is shown in Fig. 5.
A diagnosis of Familiar Interstitial Pneumonia (FIP) was made based on the patient's family history, the HRCT, progression and review of the histology. Antifibrotic therapy with pirfenidone and lung transplantation evaluation was initiated. Genetic screening was carried out with sequencing and CNV analyses of the coding regions of ABCA3, AP3B1, BLOC1S3, CSF2RA, DTNBP1, ELMOD2, HPS1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6, MUC5B, NKX21, SFTPA1, SFTPA2, SFTPB, SFTPC, SFTPD, TERC and TERT.

PMC10363678_01,PMC10363678,Female,64.0,"A 64-year-old female patient visited the orthopedic department of Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in China on October 7, 2020, due to repeated left lower extremity paresthesia and limited movement. The patient was in a normal state of consciousness during the examination, while declining cognitive, speech function, and the muscle strength of the right limb was 5-grade. Meanwhile, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine (Figure 1) showed a soft tissue mass shadow on the left side of the T11 adnexa. A cranial MRI (Figure 1) also revealed several abnormal signal shadows in the left frontal lobe and bilateral parieto-occipital lobes. The patient underwent a complete positron emission tomography (PET) scan that revealed multiple metastases throughout the body (Table 1).
In 2008, the patient had received the first treatment that was an excision of the left occipital region 14 years previously, which had been identified as having an HPC of grade II-III. Radiation therapy (RT) was then chosen by the patient after surgery. After 2 months, no sign of recurrence was discovered in the follow-up examination. Nevertheless, in March 2009, a recurrence was detected in the primary focus. The patient underwent GK following advice from an external neurosurgeon. In follow-up examinations, neither the patient's clinical symptoms nor the tumor size increased significantly. In February 2018, the patient received GK (left frontal and left temporal lesions, 40% isometric curve, 14-16 Gy peripheral dose, 35-40 Gy central dose).
A partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed on the patient in our hospital in June 2018 for a caudal pancreatic occlusion combined with bleeding (Figure 2). The immunohistochemical results (Figure 2) were positive for Vim, SMA, and B-catenin (plasma), had a focal positive result for CD34, CD99, and S-100, a weak positive result for ERG, Bc1-2, and FLI-1, and a negative result for CD117, CD56, STAT6, and Ki67 index 10%. The pathological findings at that time suggested atypical and malignant SFT (metastases).
In 2020, a mass in the lumbar spine was investigated as a possible metastatic tumor based on the patient's medical history. The patient was transferred from orthopedics to neurosurgery because of the complex conditions, and three frontotemporal tumors were removed. The swelling was fish-like in appearance, gray in color, and slightly soft in texture (Figure 3).
The pathology of the tumor cells revealed that cells were solid and grew in a lamellar way (Figure 3). The cells were also short spindle or ovoid in shape, with inconspicuous nucleoli and 6-15 nuclear fission images/10 HPF. Immunohistochemical staining suggested positive results for Vim, ERG (vascular), and CD99, and had scattered or localized positivity for S-100, CD34, NSE, and STAT6. The Ki67 index increased significantly to 15%. According to the 2016 WHO classification system for tumors of the central nervous system and in conjunction with the pathology, the final diagnosis was ISFT (WHO grade III). The patient was hospitalized on November 11, 2020, after experiencing a sudden onset of confusion. Emergency cranial computed tomography (CT) confirmed the left remaining occipital lobe mass (Figure 4). We performed total resection of the tumor. The pathological nature of the tumor was like that of the previously resected tumor, which was consistent with SFT, and postoperative MRI confirmed total tumor resection (Figure 5). Neurologically, the patient improved significantly following the operation, and muscle strength and tone returned to normal. The patient was discharged from the hospital for regular follow-up CT/MRI imaging. Afterward, liver metastasis and metastasis in the right lower abdominal wall were found by abdominal CT in March 2021 (Table 1). Considering the patient's complicated medical history, including multiple metastases throughout the body, several surgeries, and recurrence, as well as the fact that the patient had received surgery and radiation, Anlotinib targeted therapy (March 2021) and Sintilimab immunotherapy (May 2021) were given by the oncologists consecutively. The patient's treatment was well-tolerated, with no particular adverse reactions, and they are currently stable and progressing slowly. During follow-up in July 2021, the patient was treated with GK again in another hospital, and the general condition remained stable, with no obvious signs of recurrence of intracranial lesions (Figure 5).

A complete blood cell count (CBC) revealed normochromic, normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 7.1 g/dl), rouleaux formation was appreciated  on peripheral blood smear, biological inflammatory syndrome (ESR 60mm/hour, C reactive protein - positive), high lactate  dehydrogenase (LDH 301U/l), creatinine 3.97mg/dl, BUN 157mg/dl, hypokaliemia (K 3.6mmols/l), hypercalcemia (Ca - 10.31mg/dl),  hyperuricemia (8mg/dl). Serum protein electrophoresis detected a monoclonal peak limited to the gamma region of the electrophoretic strip (albumin 30%, alpha1 = 2.9%, alpha2 = 14.4%; beta = 8.7%; gamma = 44%);  immunoelectrophoresis showed high values of IgG (35g/l), with low IgA (0.295g/l) and IgM (0.497g/l); urine immunofixation detected Bence  Jones proteinuria. 
	Bone marrow aspiration was performed and revealed a hypercellular bone marrow with increased plasma cells (53%) with decreased granulocytic and erythrocytic components, with a slight megaloblastic deviation, and with present thrombocytogenic megakaryocytes  (Fig 1)
Flow cytometry analysis of the bone marrow aspirate is not included in the diagnostic criteria of multiple myeloma; in this case, no  aberrant phenotype was noted - the profile of plasma cells was CD 38+ CD 138+ CD 56+(favorable prognostic  factor) and CD 19 - (Fig 2,Fig 3).
The particular aspect of this case resides in the morphological features of the myeloma plasma cells  (Fig 4 to Fig 7). These are large cells arranged in  clusters, with basophilic cytoplasm, with excentrically placed nucleus and a perinuclear clear zone. The chromatin has a particular  nodular pattern; an inconstant nucleolus may be observed. Plasma cells had numerous large azurophilic - bright red granules  - mucopolysaccharides and immunoglobulins secreted and accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum, typically known as Russel bodies  . 
The investigations were completed with X - rays of the skull which showed multiple lytic cranial lesions and diffuse osteoporosis  (Fig 8). Spinal MRI scan identified of compression fracture of T12, L1, L2 with diffuse  osteoporosis (Fig 9).
The final diagnosis was Multiple Myeloma IgG Kappa stage III B; this was established according to Salmon-Durie Staging System   in the presence of major criteria: 53% myeloma plasma cells in bone marrow, monoclonal protein peak in serum, osteolytic lesions, corroborated with: anemia, renal failure, hypercalcemia. The multiple myeloma was complicated  with compression fracture, secondary anemia, and possibly secondary amyloidosis. The renal failure may have a combined etiology:  amyloidosis, myeloma kidney, excess NSAIDs treatment for back pain. 
With an obvious diagnosis, the differential diagnosis was easy to establish [,  ], including: a) monoclonal gammapathy of  undetermined significance (MGUS) and b) smoldering myeloma, both with monoclonal immunoglobulin in the serum less than 3g/dl, >  10% plasma cells in bone marrow, no evidence of myeloma end - organ damage - anemia, renal failure, hypercalcemia,  lytic lesions; c) Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia with IgM paraprotein peak and lymphoplasmacytic bone marrow infiltration  . 
The patient's prognosis is unfavorable  because of multiple associated factors: age, aggressive onset of disease - with  complications (acute renal failure, multiple lytic lesions, vertebral destructions that needed surgical intervention), associated cardiac pathology which limits the possible therapeutic regimens, other biological factors with prognostic value - severe anemia,  increased LDH, positive PCR. We mention that neither the percentage of plasma cell involvement of the bone marrow, nor the morphological  aspect of plasma cells represent prognostic factors - except for the case when plasmablasts are observed, or when plasma cells  appear on the peripheral blood smear (PBS).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018960/,4,images/PMC3/PMC301/PMC3018960_01

Local temperature was not raised. The skin was intact.
The investigations showed hemoglobin 6.8 g% and raised total white cell count as 16, 200 cells/cu.mm. Differential count showed neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 20%, eosinophils 4% and monocytes 1%. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 70 mm in the first hour. X-ray revealed a large lytic lesion in the left scapula, without soft tissue extension [Figure 1]. The X-ray chest showed hyperinflated lungs and bronchiectatic changes in both lungs. An abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormality.
Fine needle aspiration cytology revealed cells arranged in small groups against a hemorrhagic background. The cells were large, about 60 mu, with well-defined borders, abundant dense eosinophilic cytoplasm, pleomorphic nuclei with high N/C ratio and prominent nucleoli [Figure 2]. Occasional multinucleated tumor giant cells were also observed. The cytological findings led to a provisional diagnosis of an osteogenic sarcoma, vs. a metastatic adenocarcinoma.
The surgical biopsy specimen consisted of haemorrhagic, creamish-white tissue pieces, of aggregate 2cm. Formalin - fixed Haematoxylin and Eosin stained sections showed round to polyhedral cells arranged in the form of trabeculae, cell balls and pseudoglands separated by fine vascularized septa [Figure 3]. The nuclei were pleomorphic with large nucleoli and intranuclear inclusions. The cytoplasm was eosinophilic, granular and finely vacuolated. Mitotic activity was low (1-2/10 hpf).

His neurological examination showed diffuse 4/5 bilateral lower extremity weakness with a relative T4-sensory level to pin appreciation.
The thoracic MRI revealed a large right-sided dorsal intradural extramedullary lesion contributing to severe compression of the spinal cord at T4-level. The CT scan confirmed the lesion was hyperdense, consisting of intratumoral ossification [Figure 1]. The predominant differential diagnoses included ossified meningioma versus schwannoma.
Under neuromonitoring and following a T4-T5 laminectomy, a midline durotomy was performed. This revealed an intradural extramedullary tumor with a base adherent to the right lateral dura. The tumor was dissected off the dura allowing for gross total resection (GTR); the sensory rootlets enmeshed in the tumor capsule were easily dissected off the lesion and preserved. A watertight closure followed, and there were no intraoperative neuromonitoring changes. Within 6 postoperative months, the patient was neurologically intact except for some mild residual gait ataxia, (i.e. requiring a cane to ambulate).
Gross pathology showed the lesion was irregular, tan, and rubbery, measuring 9 x 10 x 13 mm. On microscopy, there were meningothelial cells with oval to spindle-shaped nuclei containing occasional intranuclear pseudoinclusions. Frequent swirls of psammoma bodies were also seen. Additional areas showed more extensive ""ossification"" (i.e. bone formation, osseous metaplasia).

He presented with nausea and vomiting for two days, with passage of tarry stools. He had taken only small amounts of food in the previous week. A review of his medical records revealed that he had undergone subtotal gastrectomy and a Billroth II gastrojejunal anastomosis for gastric cancer 38 years earlier. In addition, he had undergone transurethral retrograde prostatectomy for prostate cancer 30 years earlier.
At presentation, routine blood and chemistry tests showed white blood cells 30,400/mm3 (segment 80.5), hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL, C-reactive protein 17.3 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 24 mg/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, sodium 137 mmol/L, and potassium 4.6 mmol/L.
Physical examination revealed a palpable dilated bowel loop in the left lower abdomen. Abdominal sonography demonstrated a typical ""donut sign"" at axial view and ""pseudokidney sign"" at longitudinal view (Figure 1A). Small bowel intussusception was suspected. Further imaging studies with abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed multiple protruding small bowel tumors with enteroenteric intussusceptions at two sites (Figure 1B). Another bulging submucosal tumor was noted incidentally at the gastric fundus. His medical notes showed that he had undergone panendoscopy when coffee ground vomitus had been documented two weeks earlier. This demonstrated a smooth-surfaced bulging tumor without ulceration at the afferent loop below the gastrojejunal anastomosis. Another bulging tumor was seen at the efferent loop 50 cm distal to the anastomotic site (Figure 2). The tumors had a more intact mucosal surface and looked to have originated from the submucosal layer. A biopsy was taken and the pathology report favored adenocarcinoma (Figure 3). The clinical impression was that of a remnant gastric cancer with intestinal metastases.
Emergency laparotomy performed after the CT scan found two sites of enteroenteric intussusception with proximal small bowel dilatation. The small one was reduced spontaneously by manipulation at laparotomy. The larger one, located in the left lower abdomen, had a sausage-like appearance and resulted in proximal jejunal dilatation (Figure 4A). Meanwhile, there were two tumors with the appearance of serosal invasion, with one located at the afferent loop and the other located at the efferent loop near the gastrojejunal anastomotic site. Careful palpation of the whole length of the small bowel demonstrated more than three intraluminal tumor-like masses distal to the intussusception site. Revision of gastrojejunostomy with segmental resection of the afferent loop and efferent loop, including the tumor masses, and Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy were performed.
The specimen revealed a fungating tumor at the afferent loop and seven cauliflower-like tumors at the efferent loop. Three of the seven tumors resulted in the larger intussusception (Figure 4B). At the same time, a large lymph node up to 1.5 cm in size at the mesenteric root was excised for pathologic examination.
The impression was of metastatic small bowel tumors and mesenteric lymph nodes with an unknown primary. Review of previous medical records and imaging studies showed that a progressively enlarging left upper lung tumor had been found in the preceding six months (Figure 5A and 5B). Pathology showed tumor cell infiltration through the whole thickness of the bowel wall in all eight tumors. They contained both epithelial and mesenchymal elements (Figure 3B and 3C). Special staining demonstrated positivity for thyroid transcription factor-1, indirectly suggesting that the tumors were of lung origin (Figure 3D). The final diagnosis was metastatic small bowel carcinosarcoma with a lung primary.
Due to respiratory failure after the operation, a lung tumor biopsy was refused by the patient's family. Unfortunately, poor nasogastric feeding and tarry stool passage were noticed 30 days after surgery. Follow-up abdominal CT showed an intra-abdominal abscess, possibly due to anastomotic leakage. Emergency laparotomy demonstrated necrosis at the medial site of the gastrojejunostomy with abscess formation. Primary repair and adequate drainage were performed due to unstable vital signs. The patient died in multiple organ failure one month later.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3658228/,5,images/PMC3/PMC365/PMC3658228_01
PMC7771492_01,PMC7771492,Male,48.0,"A 48-year-old male patient presented with 1 year's duration of progressive right-sided neck pain, a right C6 radiculopathy, and eventually a right > left spastic quadriparesis. The MRI revealed a destructive lesion involving the C3-C5 vertebra with an epidural collection. The original diagnosis was Potts disease (radiological diagnosis alone), and anti-tubercular drugs were utilized for 3 months. He finally developed a spastic quadriplegia with bladder involvement, leading to a contrast enhanced cervical MRI (CEMRI) and holospinal - CT. When these studies confirmed a destructive C3-5 lesion with an epidural collection, unchanged from prior study, the patient underwent an anterior C3, C4 (complete), and C5 (partial) corpectomy/fusion using an expandable cage [Figure 1a-d].
The histopathology showed diffuse sheets of large atypical oval to polygonal cells admixed with lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, plasma cells, and histiocytes. The tumor cells showed oval to horseshoe shaped nuclei, coarse chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and moderate amount of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Immunohistochemistry showed tumor cells to be positive for CD3, CD4, CD7, CD8, CD30, and CD43 and negative for ALK-1, CD15, CD68, CD20, CD79a, CK, CD1A, and S-100; Ki-67 index of tumor cells was 20% [Figures 2 and 3].
For staging, a CECT scan of the neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, with bone marrow biopsy, CSF study with cytospin, and 99mTc-MDP bone scan were performed. The bone scan showed focal involvement at the operative site but there was no evidence of marrow involvement with lymphoma. The final diagnosis was primary ALK-negative ALCL of cervical spine.
In the postoperative period, he was treated with CHOEP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisolone) chemotherapy. He has received three cycles of CHOEP chemotherapy. A total of 6 cycles of CHOEP chemotherapy are planned. Postoperatively, he exhibited only mild residual spasticity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7771492/,5,images/PMC7/PMC777/PMC7771492_01
PMC6188071_01,PMC6188071,Female,73.0,"Our patient is a 73-year-old Caucasian female with medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She had been treated for invasive ductal breast cancer 7 years ago with lumpectomy of the left breast and axillary lymph node dissection. Radiation therapy and seven cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to her postoperatively, and Anastrozole was prescribed to her for 5 years. She underwent regular annual follow-up for 5 years with chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning with no signs of recurrence or metastatic disease. Seven years after the initial treatment for breast cancer, abdominal CT revealed a solid hepatic lesion at segments VI and VII measuring 7 cm in diameter as well as a 1 cm calcified lesion at the tail of the pancreas (Figure 1, left). Tumor markers AFP, CA 15-3, CA 19-9, and CEA were all within normal limits and the patient did not have any symptoms or signs of abdominal mass apart from mild tenderness on palpation of the right subcostal region. Moreover, biochemical markers of liver and pancreatic function were normal.
Subsequently the patient went through oncologic consultation, and both lesions were considered to be resectable, although controversy arose whether they were metastatic or second primary malignancies. CT-guided percutaneous biopsies or laparoscopic biopsies were proposed as minimal invasive methods of diagnosis. The patient rejected both of them due to the risk for possible complications and cancer spillage and decided to undergo laparotomy, open rapid biopsy, and excision of the lesions in one procedure. After accessing the peritoneal cavity through an extended right subcostal incision, we performed hepatic mobilization and exposure of the right hepatic lobe. A solid mass was recognized at hepatic segments VI and VII and rapid biopsy was taken which showed primary HCC. Moreover, after entering the lesser sac, a second rapid biopsy was taken from the lesion at the pancreatic tail which showed chronic fibrosis without elements of malignancy (Figure 2A). We decided to perform resection of hepatic segments VI and VII since intraoperative hepatic ultrasound also confirmed that the mass was resectable with safe oncologic margins. Hepatic segmentectomy was achieved using a microwave tissue coagulator to mark and coagulate the margins of hepatectomy and ultrasound harmonic scalpel to transect the hepatic parenchyma with a minimal blood loss of 40 cc (Figure 3). Moreover, argon beam coagulator and fibrin glue were used to seal the raw liver surface and prophylactic cholecystectomy was also performed. Finally, the pancreatic lesion was left intact since malignancy was not confirmed with rapid biopsy.
Pathology report described a hepatic mass with maximum diameter of 6.5 cm which consisted of malignant cells with mild to severe atypia and low to medium mitotic rate. Immunohistochemistry showed that cancer cells highly expressed keratins 8/18, Hep-Par 1 and AFP and did not express keratin 7 and GATA-3 (Figure 2B-D). Endothelial cells within the mass were positive for CD 34. The gallbladder along with the cystic lymph node was normal. The final diagnosis was low-grade HCC with liver margins widely free from malignant infiltration.
The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. The subdiaphragmatic and subhepatic drains were removed on the third postoperative day without signs of hemorrhage or bile leakage and the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day. Follow-up abdominal CT scanning on the first and sixth month after the operation showed subcapsular hepatic fluid collection without recurrence of the HCC (Figure 1, right). The patient remains disease free 2 years after the hepatic segmentectomy without any adjuvant therapy.

PMC8074681_01,PMC8074681,Female,30.0,"A 30 year old female, without significant medical history, presented with recent aggravation of a thoraco-abdominal venous circulation developed during her pregnancy, five years earlier. She had no other complaint or symptom. Clinical abdominal and cardiovascular examinations did not reveal any specific clinical signs of portal hypertension or SVC syndrome.
Duplex ultrasound (DUS) showed dilatation of collateral veins, while the IVC was patent. Chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) (Revolution Evo G.E. Medical, Chicago, IL, USA) demonstrated an intraluminal heterogeneous mass in the SVC, extending from the left brachiocephalic venous trunk to the distal third of the SVC (Fig. 1A). No other mass or adenopathy was present. Thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (Ingenia Philips 3T, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) confirmed the intraluminal SVC location of the tumour, measuring 80 x 33 mm, with a cystic portion demonstrating heterogeneous T1 weighted and T2 weighted signal (Fig. 1B and C). The azygos vein had not been invaded. Positron emission tomography (Vision Siemens, Munich, Germany) demonstrated moderate fluorodeoxyglucose enhancement (SUV max: 4.8). Transthoracic sonography confirmed no extension into the right atrium. The oncology multidisciplinary staff reviewed the preliminary findings and suspected a primary SVC tumour or SVC thrombosis. A direct biopsy was too risky in terms of spread if malignant, and an endovascular biopsy would not have been sufficient. It was decided to perform surgical resection without radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
Surgery consisted of an en bloc resection of the tumour through a median sternotomy. The SVC was resected from its junction with the right atrium without myocardial breach and taking both left and right brachiocephalic veins. The venous reconstruction consisted of a 16 mm diameter, ringed, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) prosthesis (Gore-Tex, W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) sutured distally to the right atrium junction and proximally, perpendicularly on an 8 mm diameter ringed ePTFE prosthesis, connecting both right and left venous confluences (Fig. 2A). There was no need for cardiopulmonary bypass during the intervention. A left brachiobasilic fistula was created to increase blood flow and avoid thrombosis of the prosthesis. The post-operative course was complicated by a pericardial effusion with signs of right heart failure, without any complications of the venous reconstruction. A pericardial drain was placed as an emergency. The patient was discharged on day 26 with anticoagulant therapy (warfarin 7.5 mg once a day), as recommended in venous bypass. Six month DUS and CTA follow up showed graft patency. Fistula closure and anticoagulation interruption were conducted seven months post-operatively.
Pathological examination showed a tumour measuring 55 x 34 x 25 mm, filling the SVC lumen (Fig. 3A and B). Microscopic analysis identified a vascular lesion with lobular architecture, consisting of multiple capillaries lining unstratified endothelium without atypia separated by a fibro-oedematous stroma (Fig. 3C and D). Immunohistochemical analysis showed vascular markers, CD31 and ERG, characterising the endothelium. No sign of malignancy was found and the Ki67 proliferation index was low. After confirmation with the Reseau de Reference en Pathologie des Sarcomes des Tissus Mous (National French Reference Network of Soft Tissues Sarcomas), the final diagnosis was an ILCH in the SVC, also known as pyogenic granuloma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8074681/,2,images/PMC8/PMC807/PMC8074681_01
PMC7133003_01,PMC7133003,Male,65.0,"A 65-year-old man came to our observation with a solid-elastic mass of about 4.5 cm maximum diameter on the proximal region of the left forearm, ulnar side, that appeared hypomobile on the underline planes. He reported being affected by this ""bump"" for at least 20 years, but it had recently shown a rapid growth. Furthermore, he reported having already undergone another excision in local anesthesia after an ultrasound examination about 1 year before at another hospital. An X-ray of the forearm showed a soft tissue mass with irregular calcifications (Fig. 1) and CT scan of the limb confirmed this finding. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed a soft tissue mass arising in the subcutis and involving the skin and the subfascial and muscular planes, with partial invasion of wrist and fingers flexor muscles and partially surrounding the bone (lateral side of the ulna). The mass was isointense to muscle in T1-weighted sequence (Fig. 2a), hyperintense on T2-weighted sequence (Fig. 2b), with contrast medium enhancement on T1-weighted sequence (Fig. 2c) and highly vascular (Fig. 3). Staging exams (total body Computed Tomography scan and Positron Emission Tomography scan), showed no other tumor localizations.
After preoperative needle biopsy, surgical excision of the tumor was performed, including skin (with the scar of the previous surgery), fascia, muscles and a portion of the ulna. Reconstruction was performed with plate, screws and cement and coverage with a microsurgical rotation flap.
Gross examination of the surgical specimen revealed a solid white neoplasm with a maximum diameter of 6 cm in the soft tissues. Histologically, the tumor showed two different, abruptly separated components (Fig. 4). One consisted of a proliferation of atypical spindle or ovoid cells with cigar-shaped nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in long interlacing fascicles, an appearance consistent with leiomyosarcoma (Fig. 5). The other component consisted of atypical pleomorphic cells producing osteoid matrix in disorganized trabeculae with focal calcification (Fig. 6). Areas of cartilage matrix production were identified as well.
Immunohistochemically, areas with leiomyosarcomatous appearance were strongly positive for alpha smooth muscle actin (Fig. 7a) and desmin (Fig. 7b), whereas the osteosarcomatous component was negative. Both components were negative for cytokeratins (AE1/AE3 and CAM5.2), EMA, S100 protein, CD34 and CD31. SATB2, a marker of osteoblastic differentiation was positive only in the osteosarcomatous component, whereas leiomyosarcoma areas were negative (Fig. 7c, d).
The final diagnosis was leiomyosarcoma grade 2, according to the French Federation of Comprehensive Cancer Centers (FNCLCC) grading system with areas of high-grade osteosarcoma (so-called dedifferentiated leiomyosarcoma). The tumor infiltrated the dermis, the subcutis and the striated muscle. Surgical margins were free of tumour. The review of the histologic slides from the previous surgical excision showed similar histological aspects, although the tumor consisted mainly of leiomyosarcoma with a very limited osteosarcomatous component.
After the surgical treatment, the patient received three cycles of high-dose adjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin and iphosphamide and local sequential radiotherapy (66 Gy). After an interval of 15 months, MRI showed multiple local recurrences at the site of previous excisions and a PET CT total body scan highlighted bilateral pulmonary nodules, for which he underwent a new cycle of chemotherapy with gentamicin. The patient died after 23 months from presentation due to the progression of the disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133003/,12,images/PMC7/PMC713/PMC7133003_01
PMC5340653_01,PMC5340653,Male,48.0,"A 48-year-old Samoan man underwent a colonoscopy and endoscopy to evaluate a history of chronic diarrhea and recent significant weight loss of >20 kilograms. His past medical history was significant for recurrent polyarticular gout for >7 years, which had caused significant physical impairment. On clinical examination his weight was 84 kg (body mass index, 25 kg/m2). Inspection of the hands revealed swelling and enlargement of the proximal interphalangeal joints, and a gouty tophus was visible on the tragus of the right ear. The systemic examination was otherwise normal.
Biochemical analysis showed mild anemia (124 g/L) and leukocytosis (12.7 x 109/L) with lymphocytosis (5.75 x 109/L). C-reactive protein was elevated at 71 mg/L. Liver function tests showed elevated alkaline phosphotase (351 U/L) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (277 U/L) with hypoalbuminemia (25 g/L). The urate level was 0.68 mmol/L, and microbiological investigations of stool samples were negative. A joint aspiration showed negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals with sterile cultures. A liver ultrasound was normal.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy identified gastric mucosal atrophy and blunted villi in the duodenum (Figure 1). Duodenal mucosal biopsies showed preserved villous architecture with some deposition of eosinophilic material within the lamina propria and vessel walls. The eosinophilic material stained positive with Congo red (Figure 2). A colonoscopy was macroscopically normal. Biopsies from the terminal ileum showed mild villous blunting, fibrosis of submucosa, and eosinophilic material that stained positive with Congo red within the lamina propria and vessel walls. Immunohistochemistry of duodenal and terminal ileum sections tested positive for serum AA protein. Kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chain and transthyretin immunohistochemical stains were negative. Proteomic analysis demonstrated the amyloid deposits to be comprised of serum amyloid A (SAA)-2 protein.
The results were consistent with a diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. A search for additional causes of secondary amyloidosis failed to identify any other immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or chronic infections including tuberculosis. Thus, the final diagnosis was systemic AA amyloidosis with GI involvement due to polyarticular tophaceous gout.
Echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed no evidence of cardiac amyloid infiltration, and renal investigations revealed proteinuria of 450 mg/day with normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The patient was commenced on a weaning course of prednisolone, and colchicine was started at 500 mug. His dose of allopurinol was increased from 100 mg to 300 mg once daily. During outpatient follow-up, he reported that the GI symptoms had started to improve gradually following the resolution of the gout exacerbations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5340653/,3,images/PMC5/PMC534/PMC5340653_01
PMC5554986_01,PMC5554986,Male,66.0,"A 66-year-old man underwent investigation for persistent anorexia and fatigue which had persisted for one month. On his past history and family history, there was nothing noteworthy, including no evidence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type1or von Hippel-Lindau disease. And he was not a smoker or a drinker. On his occupational history, he had not worked in printing industry where incidence of the bile duct carcinoma is known to be high. On his physical examination, the bulbar conjunctiva was yellow. Laboratory tests showed that the values of hepatobiliary enzymes were increased (T-Bil was 8.9 mg/dl, D-Bil was 5.6 mg/dl, AST was 377 U/L, ALT was 653 U/L, ALP was 1105 U/l, and gamma-GTP was 2291 U/l). CEA and CA19-9 were within normal limits. On abdominopelvic contrast-enhanced CT, an enhancing 10 mm x 8 mm hypervascular tumor was observed in the distal bile duct and the proximal bile duct was markedly dilated (Fig. 1). MRCP demonstrated a filling defect spanning 10 mm in the maximal diameter in the distal bile duct with markedly dilatation of the proximal bile duct. There was no evidence of pancreatobiliary maljunction (Fig. 2). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) also showed a stenosis of 10 mm in the maximal diameter was observed in the distal bile duct (Fig. 3). Examination of a biopsy specimen obtained from the narrow site of the bile duct at the time of ERC revealed moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. With a preoperative diagnosis of distal bile duct cancer, pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. On surgical findings, a median incision was made in the upper abdomen and observation of the abdominal cavity did not reveal tumor dissemination or liver metastasis. The tumor was palpable as an induration in the distal bile duct. Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (Child II-A) was performed. The operating time was 343 min and blood loss was 533 mlMacroscopic findings (Fig. 4) shows a white nodular infiltrating tumor of 10 mm in the maximal diameter was observed in the distal bile duct. Histopathological findings (Fig. 5) shows the tumor composed of cells in solid clusters and cells forming tubular structures with abundant fibrous stroma. The solid clustered cells were positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin -A in immunohistochemistry, which indicated neuroendocrine differentiation. The cells also showed numerous mitoses and high-Ki-67 labeling index (25 mitotic figures/10 HPF; 30% Ki-67-positive). The proportion of each component was at least 30%. The final diagnosis was the mixed adeno-neuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC), large cell type. The pathological stage was pT3, pN1, M0, and pStage II B according to the TNM classification of the UICC.

PMC3891414_01,PMC3891414,Male,62.0,"A 62-year-old man visited the emergency room complaining of epigastric and periumbilical pain, which had developed 3 hours prior to his admission. The nature of his complaint was colicky pain, but he had experienced neither nausea nor vomiting. He had no history of abdominal surgery, allergic disease, or food sensitivity. Physical examination revealed right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, but no rebound tenderness. The patient's leukocyte count was 10,420/mm3 (2.9% eosinophils, normal range [NR], 0~5%). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) examination showed segmental wall thickening of the small bowel and proximal dilatation, mesenteric edema, and focal fluid collection in the adjacent peritoneal cavity (Figure 1). However, there was no abrupt transition in the luminal diameter at either end of the pathologic bowel loop, suggesting a radiological abnormality, other than the strangulation normally observed in a case of intestinal obstruction. The radiological differential diagnosis included segmental enteritis of unclear cause, and focal mesenteric ischemia by a certain kind of systemic vasculitis, or post- strangulation state following the relief of obstruction. Twelve hours after his admission to the emergency room, the abdominal pain progressed, rebound tenderness developed, and finally, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. Exploration revealed edema, congestion, and bluish discoloration of the distal ileum, 50 cm from the ileocecal valve. Only a 15 cm segment was involved, and the remaining bowel was seen to be normal. The proximal bowel was dilated and the distal bowel had collapsed. The involved ileal segment was resected, and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. Gross examination showed an ill-defined mass-like wall thickening with multifocal erosion of the overlying mucosa, 7 centimeters in length, and the surrounding small intestinal mucosa was moderately edematous. Histologically, extensive eosinophilic infiltration was found in the mass-like lesion, which was found from submucosa to subserosa (Figure 2). In the surrounding mucosa, edema with increased eosinophils was also observed. There was found to be no evidence of parasites, granulomas, malignancy, vasculitis, or embolism in the surgical specimen, either in the bowel wall or in the mesenteric vessels. The final diagnosis was eosinophilic enteritis. Two days after the operation, the patient's leukocyte count decreased to 8,070/mm3 (8.7% eosinophils). The pain disappeared and he was discharged normally. At the outpatient clinic, 12 days after the operation, the patient's total IgE was 1,310 u/mL above the normal range (0~100 u/mL), but skin prick test was normal, suggesting no specific allergic etiology. Seventeen days after the operation, similar characteristic abdominal pain developed again in the patient's periumbilical area, but to a milder degree than before the operation. The patient was advised to undergo gastroenterological testing in order to evaluate the abdominal pain, but he refused. Instead he (60 kg-weight) received 40 mg intramuscular injections of methylprednisolone acetate for two days, and simultaneously took 10 mg prednisolone three times per day, resulting in improvement of abdominal pain. Two weeks after this abdominal pain attack, hematochezia occurred for 4 days, in spite of continuous 30 mg prednisolone per day. The patient experienced dizziness, and his hemoglobin decreased from 13.6 g/dL (NR, 13-17 g/dL) to 9.5 g/dL. He was readmitted for a diagnostic work-up. Emergency colonoscopy showed no evidence of bleeding after bowel preparation with colyte, nor did it reveal any definite mucosal abnormality up to the ileocecal valve. Although there was no definite intrinsic mucosal lesion, six pieces of blind biopsy were taken from the hepatic flexure and 40 cm above the anal verge, but the pathologic results indicated only nonspecific change. In addition, gastroduodenoscopy up to the 3rd portion of duodenum revealed no abnormalities, and there was no evidence of bleeding. On the next day, the initial negative 99mTc-tagged red blood cell scan showed a small amount of bleeding from the right iliac artery 2 hours and 30 minutes after injection of 99mTc-tagged red blood cells, and migration of blood into the right ileal lumen after 4 hours and 30 minutes. However, CT angiography and arteriography, which were taken successively, showed no focus of bleeding, indicating that the bleeding had already stopped, or that the bleeding speed was slower than 0.5 mL/min. On the next day, M2A  capsule endoscopy was performed. It showed that multiple hemorrhagic spots were scattered throughout the proximal jejunum (Figure 3A). After the normal jejunal segment, abrupt spurting of fresh arterial bleeding was detected in the mid-to-distal jejunum, but no ulcer, mass or vascular abnormalities were detected (Figure 3B). The ileum was normal, and the anastomotic site at the ileum was not noticed, suggesting no definite lesion around the previous operation site. Just 8 hours after the capsule endoscopy examination, a large amount of hematochezia, dizziness, and diaphoresis occurred, along with a decrease in hemoglobin level, from 9.7 g/dL to 6.9 g/dL. The patient did not take oral prednisolone during the 2 days of examination due to the unavailability of an oral intake state. Immediately after the detection of massive hematochezia, intravascular injections of 125 mg methylprednisolone sodium succinate per every 8 hours were started, and an emergency operation was prepared. Surprisingly, the hemoglobin increased to 10.7 g/dL with 3 packs of RBC transfusion, suggesting termination of the bleeding. Thereafter, the patient's hematochezia was undetected, and his hemoglobin remained stable. Five days later, the methylprednisolone sodium succinate injections were replaced with oral prednisolone treatment, 60 mg per day for 2 days, which was to taper down over a two-week period. The patient has been asymptomatic for 15 months with no medical therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891414/,5,images/PMC3/PMC389/PMC3891414_01
PMC3934807_01,PMC3934807,Female,75.0,"A 75-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and osteoporosis consulted her local physician for occasional upper abdominal discomfort. She was referred and admitted to our hospital for evaluation and treatment. No abdominal tumor mass or superficial lymph nodes were palpable. Routine laboratory findings were unremarkable, with the exception of slightly elevated serum AFP (10.5 ng/ml). Gastroscopy revealed a 20-mm type 2 tumor, primarily in the pyloric region. Histological examination of gastroscopic biopsies confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma (moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma), but no detailed information was obtained. Barium enema confirmed a type 2 tumor in the pyloric region. No obvious lymph node metastasis or remote metastasis was observed on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT).
Thus, with a provisional diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, we performed laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection. Macroscopically, the type 2 tumor was located near the pylorus and measured 20 x 15 mm (fig. 1a). It invaded vertically into the muscularis propria, and two regional lymph node metastases were observed microscopically. Histological examination demonstrated the presence of adenocarcinoma with a tubulopapillary growth pattern (fig. 1b). Tumor cells were cuboidal in shape with characteristically clear cytoplasm. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain showed that the clear cytoplasm was almost filled with fine granular glycogen (fig. 1c). The tumor cells were negative in mucin in either alcian blue-PAS stain, but also in the immunohistochemistry for MUC2 (goblet cell mucin) or MUC5AC (foveolar mucin).
Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for AFP (fig. 2a), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (fig. 2b), caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) (fig. 2c) and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CD10) (fig. 2d). AFP was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm whereas CEA was positive in the apical surfaces of tumor cells. CDX2 was expressed strongly in the tumor cell nuclei. CD10 was positive in the luminal surfaces in some tumor cells. The tumor was immunohistochemically negative in synaptophysin, chromogranin A and CD56 (NCAM), though a few chromogranin A and few synaptophysin-positive neuroendocrine cells were found scattering among clear carcinoma cells. Human chorionic gonadotropin was not found in tumor cells. The final diagnosis was AFP-producing gastric carcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation. Lymph node metastases showed similar histological and immunohistochemical results as the primary site.
The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and AFP levels normalized to 3.7 ng/ml. She was followed without adjuvant chemotherapy because of her advanced age. However, 15 months after the initial surgery, serum levels of AFP increased to 279.4 ng/ml, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed No. 8p lymph node recurrence (fig. 3a). Therefore, chemotherapy combining cisplatin (CDDP) and etoposide (VP-16) was conducted for six courses. The size of lymph node recurrence initially decreased, but she consulted our hospital for upper abdominal pain and vomiting 26 months after the initial surgery. A CT scan revealed gastrointestinal obstruction near the anastomotic site of gastroduodenostomy due to No. 8p lymph node recurrence (fig. 3b). As it was difficult to continue chemotherapy, she underwent palliative gastrojejunostomy. The surgery temporarily restored adequate oral intake, but she received repeated blood transfusions for uncontrollable gastrointestinal bleeding, and serum levels of AFP increased to 8,634 ng/ml. 29 months after initial surgery, the patient died.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3934807/,4,images/PMC3/PMC393/PMC3934807_01

A physical examination revealed a hard, palpable mass with mild tenderness in her right lower abdomen. An ultrasound scan and a computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed a large oval cystic and solid mass measuring 9.4 cm x 8.4 cm x 8.3 cm with irregular separation. The preoperative serum levels of cancer antigen (CA)-125, CA19-9, CA72-4, human epididymis protein 4, carcinoembryonic antigen, and alpha-fetoprotein were all within the normal range. A laparotomy revealed a large right ovarian cystic mass with an old surface rupture (1.0 cm x 1.0 cm) and proliferation of granulation tissue. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and partial omentectomy were performed. Malignant cells were not found on cytologic examination of the peritoneal washing fluid. The tumor was staged as International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) grade IC. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient underwent three cycles of chemotherapy with 210 mg paclitaxel liposome via an intravenous drip, 20 mg nedaplatin via an intravenous drip, and 80 mg nedaplatin via intraperitoneal perfusion. She has been followed up for 3 years without evidence of tumor recurrence and metastasis.
Macroscopic examination of the right ovary showed a brownish mass with a smooth outer surface. The mass was composed of multilocular cysts filled with turbid tan fluid or clear mucinous material. Yellowish papillary structures were found projecting into the cystic cavities. The septa of these cysts had uneven thickness, from 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm. The mass contained two distinct solid nodules. The larger one measured 3.0 cm x 2.8 cm x 2.5 cm, protruded into the cystic lumen, and was well-circumscribed. It was gray-brown, with a medium consistency and visible hemorrhage and necrosis. The smaller nodule measured 1.6 cm in diameter and was gray and hard. The right fallopian tube was found adherent to the capsule of the tumor. The left ovary and fallopian tubes were unremarkable. The surface of the greater omentum showed numerous small sallow nodules of various sizes, from 0.2 to 0.4 cm in diameter.
Microscopic examination showed that the right ovarian tumor was composed of three distinct components. The cystic component was preponderant, and the cysts were lined largely by low columnar or cuboidal well-differentiated mucinous epithelium, indicating a benign tumor with focal borderline changes and intraepithelial carcinoma (Fig. 1A). The second component was mesenchymal. The larger mural nodule underneath the mucinous epithelium consisted of ovoid mononucleated cells and numerous multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells (Fig. 1B). The mononucleated cells contained abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with ill-defined borders and showed marked nuclear pleomorphism and atypia with vesicular hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Multinucleated giant cells were distributed evenly between the mononuclear cells. Foci of extensive or focal necrosis and hemorrhage presented throughout the tumor, but only a sparse inflammatory infiltrate was observed. Local hypocellular areas formed spongy-appearing foci, which were filled with diffusate or erythrocytes. Mitotic figures were frequent and sometimes atypical (Fig. 1C), and approximately 25 mitoses per 10 high-power fields were recorded. Vascular invasion was also observed in this mural nodule (Fig. 1D). The larger nodule was sharply demarcated from the epithelial elements. As the third component, the smaller nodule consisted of nests of transitional epithelium, which embedded in a dense fibromatous stroma (Fig. 1E). Occasional transitional nests with central dilation were present in the transition areas of mucinous tumor and Brenner tumor. The greater omental lesions consisted of little nests or sheets of cohesive polygonal-to-oval epithelioid cells with distinct cell borders, abundant cytoplasm, and inconspicuous nucleoli (Fig. 1F).
Immunohistochemical staining for two mural nodules was performed using the Ventana BenchMark XT system (Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland). The mononucleated and multinucleated cells in the sarcomatous mural nodule were positive for vimentin (Fig. 2A), cluster of differentiation (CD)56, CD68 (Fig. 2B), and human alpha1 antichymotrypsin, but negative for pan-cytokeratin (CK), CK7, CK20, desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, calretinin, CD10, and P63. Some mononucleated cells showed positive staining for S-100 protein. Staining with CD34 revealed intravascular tumor emboli and vascular invasion (Fig. 2C). MIB-1 staining indicated that the mononucleated cells had very high proliferative activity (approximately 35%). The mononuclear cells on the surface of the greater omentum showed diffuse and strong reactivity against vimentin (Fig. 3A) and CD68 (Fig. 3B). There were a few scattered mesothelial cells among the mononuclear cells that stained positive for calretinin (Fig. 3C) and CK5/6. MIB-1 staining indicated that these cells had very low proliferative activity (approximately 3%).
The final diagnosis was ovarian mucinous cystic tumor (including mucinous cystadenoma, mucinous cystadenoma of borderline malignancy, and intraepithelial carcinoma) associated with mural nodules of pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma and benign Brenner tumor, and accompanied by nodular histiocytic aggregates in the greater omentum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6370064/,3,images/PMC6/PMC637/PMC6370064_01
PMC8804540_01,PMC8804540,Male,13.0,"A 13-year-old male patient presented to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Shahid Beheshti Dental School in Tehran, with the chief complaint of a swelling on his maxillary gingiva in the left side, and ectopic eruption of maxillary left canine noticed 1 month ago according to his mother. There was no history of pain or bleeding from the site of swelling. The patient's past dental history was unremarkable. His past medical history was noncontributory, and there was no history of trauma.
Extra-oral examination showed facial asymmetry in the lip line and upper lip area due to the underlying swelling with no change in the overlying skin. No lymphadenopathies were detected in the head and neck region.
Intraoral examination revealed a solitary, well-circumscribed, nontender, dome-shaped growth of approximately 2 cm located in the anterior aspect of the left maxillary alveolar ridge. The surface of the lesion was smooth, and pink to red in color. The lesion was nonfluctuant, and had a firm consistency. No sign of blanching was seen with pressure [Figure 1]. Ectopic eruption of tooth #11 into the buccal vestibule was evident. Grade 2 mobility of tooth #10 was documented. No obvious local irritant was present at the time of examination, and the patient's oral hygiene was acceptable.
Panoramic examination revealed the presence of an ill-defined lesion, extending from tooth #10 to the first premolar region, presenting a fine ground-glass pattern [Figure 2]. Cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) images revealed an ill-defined lesion, extending from the palatal aspect of tooth #10 anteriorly, with significant buccal cortical plate expansion and destruction. The lesion had a slightly higher radiodensity than the surrounding soft tissue. Furthermore, thinning of the palatal cortical plate in the canine region was detected, but sinus and nasal floor were both intact. Superior and distal displacement of tooth #11 and a ""floating in the air"" appearance were also evident. External resorption and dilaceration of the mesial root of tooth #12 were also noted [Figure 3].
Based on the clinical and radiographic findings indicating a relatively invasive bony destruction with a high growth rate, differential diagnosis was central giant cell granuloma and sarcoma, respectively. Incisional biopsy under local anesthesia was planned for the patient. Needle aspiration was performed before the procedure, which was negative. The peripheral lesion was completely excised, and incisional biopsy was performed for the intraosseous part of the lesion. Histological evaluation of the peripheral specimen revealed highly cellular fibro-vascular connective tissue with active fibroblasts, woven bone, cementum-like structures, and osteoid formation. The tissue was partially covered by ulcerated para-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium [Figure 4]. The findings were suggestive of peripheral OF (POF). The intraosseous part of the lesion showed a similar histopathological pattern.
The patient was admitted to a hospital 2 months after his first surgical procedure for enucleation and curettage under general anesthesia. The lesion was completely enucleated along with teeth #10 and #11, followed by a complete curettage of the site. Tooth #10 was completely mobile and had a hopeless prognosis at the time of surgery. The gross specimen was approximately 3 cm x 2.5 cm x 2 cm with a creamy color and firm to hard consistency [Figure 5]. The assessment of the excisional biopsy specimen showed a partially encapsulated fibro-osseous lesion composed of fragments of woven bone with osteoblastic rim, particles of cementum-like calcifications, and some osteoid formation in cellular fibrous connective tissue. The specimen was partially covered by parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium [Figure 6]. It should be noted that histopathologic features of juvenile ossifying fibroma (JOF) and OF are similar. Based on histologic features such as abundance of osteoid and woven bone formation and the zonal pattern of cementum-like ossicles and correlation of clinical and radiographic findings, the final diagnosis was JOF.
The patient has been on the regular follow-up ever since. Radiographic examination was performed after 6 months by CBCT [Figure 7]. There was no clinical or radiographic evidence of recurrence, and complete healing of the surrounding tissues was observed [Figure 8]. No sign of recurrence was evident in 14-month recall.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8804540/,6,images/PMC8/PMC880/PMC8804540_01
PMC5410482_01,PMC5410482,Female,40.0,"A 40-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with abnormal findings on chest X-ray. Her medical history was remarkable in that she had had a pleomorphic adenoma in the right parotid gland treated with enucleation in our hospital approximately 12 years prior. That tumor had been 3.6x3.2 cm in diameter, and while partial extracapsular growth and invasion of the capsular blood vessels were observed, there had been no cervical lymph node metastasis.
A chest X-ray revealed bilateral multiple nodules (Fig. 1). A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed well-defined non-calcified nodular lesions of the bilateral lobes, with a maximum diameter of 11 mm (Fig. 2). 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed slightly positive signals (SUVmax: 1.0) in multiple lung nodules. For a diagnosis, two nodules of the right upper lobe and one nodule of the right median lobe were partially resected by thoracoscopy. A macroscopic examination showed well-demarcated whitish solid masses with surfaces that were not smooth. A histological examination showed that the tumors contained a central epithelial component with proliferating polygonal or fusiform epithelial cells without nuclear atypia, and a peripheral mesenchymal component with loose fusiform cells in a myxoid stroma. In the surgical specimen of the parotid gland obtained 12 years previously, the tumor cells exhibited vascular and subcapsular invasion. These pathological findings were highly similar to the current findings, and thus the tumors were considered to have the same origin (Fig. 3).
An immunohistochemical analysis was positive for pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and S-100 protein in the epithelial cells. The mesenchymal cells were negative for AE1/AE3 and positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the border zone between the epithelial and mesenchymal cells (Fig. 4). The MIB-1 labeling index (L.I.) was less than 3%. The final diagnosis was metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma. Supporting the theory that the new tumor represented a local recurrence of the previous parotid gland tumor, a 17-mm section of the right parotid gland tumor was examined by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. 5).
Resection of the local recurrence was likely to cause facial nerve paralysis, so this patient is being followed closely without treatment. In the three months since the diagnosis, enlargement of the local recurrence site and metastasis have not been observed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5410482/,9,images/PMC5/PMC541/PMC5410482_01
PMC5505917_01,PMC5505917,Female,23.0,"A 23-year-old woman developed general fatigue, a low-grade fever, and polyarthralgia in January 2010. On admission to our University Hospital in April 2010, she was diagnosed with SLE based on the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), including arthritis, leukocytopenia (2,600/muL), positive antinuclear antibody (x1,280), and positive anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA antibody (28.7 U/mL). A clinical examination and laboratory tests showed a fever (body temperature 37.3 C), bilateral axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (22 mm/h), and hypocomplementemia (C4 9 mg/dL, CH50 20 U/mL). The SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score was 9, and the disease activity was considered moderately high. Renal function tests were normal, with a normal urinalysis and normal creatinine level (creatinine 0.49 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate 127.22 mL/min/1.73 m2, urinary protein excretion 0.04 g/day, urinary sediment of red blood cells <1/high power field, and urinary sediment of white blood cells <1/high power field). However, because hypocomplementemia and serological abnormalities [positive antinuclear antibody, positive anti-ds DNA antibody, and positive anti-Smith (Sm) antibody (64 IU/mL)] were observed, informed consent about renal biopsy was obtained from the patient, and a renal biopsy was performed. An examination of H&E-stained renal biopsy tissue showed normal glomeruli (Fig. 1A). However, marked deposition of complement and IgG in the glomeruli was noted in immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1B). The glomerular lesion was classified as ISN/RPS class I lupus nephritis. However, 10 interlobular arteries were included in 7 resected specimens, and vasculitis was detected in 9 of them. Furthermore, necrotizing vasculitis was evident in three interlobular arteries. This included fibrinoid necrosis, prominent infiltration around the blood vessel wall with inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, and tears of the elastic laminae of the arteries (Fig. 1C).
We next investigated the reason for the renal small-vessel vasculitis. Before admission, the patient had not been using any drugs that could have induced necrotizing vasculitis in small vessels (e.g., anti-thyroid agents, d-penicillamine, hydralazine, minocycline, or omeprazole). Furthermore, the patient had no symptoms suggestive of systemic vasculitis, and computed tomography (CT) angiography showed no abnormalities (e.g., stenosis or small aneurysm). Lastly, there were no significant abnormalities in the serum levels of ANCA or cryoglobulin, and the patient was free of infection and malignancy. Accordingly, the final diagnosis was established as TRLV with ISN/RPS class I lupus nephritis after the exclusion of all other forms of vasculitis, including drug-, cancer-, and infection-associated vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, ANCA-associated vasculitis, and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. The involvement of other organs, including neuropsychiatric syndromes of SLE was ruled out based on the clinical presentation.
TRLV is often resistant to corticosteroid therapy and associated with a poor renal outcome. To assess drug resistance and select the appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, we determined the P-gp expression on lymphocytes by flow cytometry on admission. The percentages of P-gp-positively stained CD4+ and CD19+ peripheral lymphocytes were 7.0% and 40.1%, respectively (Fig. 2A). We reported previously that only a small proportion of peripheral lymphocytes express P-gp in normal individuals (CD4+ lymphocytes: 4.9+-2.1%, CD19+ lymphocytes: 3.1+-3.1%, mean +- SD). Thus, the percentage of P-gp-expressing CD19+ lymphocytes was definitely higher in our SLE patient than in normal subjects. To confirm the involvement of P-gp-positive CD19+ lymphocytes in the foci of active vasculitis, serial sections of the renal tissue specimen were immunohistochemically stained for CD19 and P-gp. Marked infiltration of CD19+ lymphocytes and P-gp-positive lymphocytes was noted in the perivascular area of vasculitis; therefore, the P-gp+ CD19+ lymphocytes were suggested to have accumulated around the vasculitis (Fig. 2B, C). These findings further confirmed the involvement of P-gp overexpression on activated CD19+ lymphocytes in resistance to corticosteroids, in addition to the poor renal outcome associated with the pathological process of TRLV.
Based on the above findings, intensive immunosuppressive therapy was required for P-gp+ B cell-associated active TRLV in the patient. We selected high-dose corticosteroids combined with cyclophosphamide, which is used for the initial induction of small- and medium-vessel vasculitis, and obtained informed consent from the patient. The patient was treated with biweekly IVCY (15 mg/kg/day) combined with oral betamethasone (equivalent to 1.0 mg/kg/day of prednisolone) (Fig. 3). Immediate clinical improvement was noted after two courses of biweekly IVCY, along with normalization of the ESR, complement and anti-ds DNA antibody, followed by clinical remission (SLEDAI score: 0). After six courses of IVCY, the resolution of bilateral axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted, together with a decrease in the ANA to x80. Subsequently, IVCY was switched to oral azathioprine as maintenance therapy, and the administration of corticosteroids was gradually reduced and discontinued. Under such treatment, the clinical remission and normal renal function were maintained for more than three years (Fig. 3). Repeated biweekly IVCY (15 mg/kg/day) resulted in the development of leukocytopenia, but cessation of IVCY resulted in the normalization of the leukocyte count. The patient did not experience any severe side effects, such as severe infections, in relation to the treatment or during the observation period.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5505917/,1,images/PMC5/PMC550/PMC5505917_01
PMC4643456_01,PMC4643456,Female,72.0,"A 72-year-old-woman was admitted to the emergency department for uremic syndrome, hemodynamic instability and chronic abdominal pain associated with constipation for 2 weeks. She had a history of nephrectomy and chronic renal failure without replacement therapy of renal function and hypertension. She was treated with telmisartan-hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine and furosemide.
Three weeks before the current admission she was on treatment for hyperkalemia with calcium polystyrene sulfonate PO 29.92 g daily.
At the emergency department she was treated with polyethylene glycol powder for oral solution 4 l at conventional dilution, and rectal enemas with buffered sodium phosphate solution for constipation treatment.
She was admitted to the ICU with metabolic acidosis and uremia exacerbation requiring hemodialysis in the next 48 h.
One day after the admission to the ICU the abdominal distension augmented. Abdominal CT shows free intraperitoneal air consistent with colonic perforation (Fig. 1).
The patient went to exploratory laparotomy where a perforation at the sigmoid colon was found (Fig. 2). A Hartmann procedure was performed and open abdomen protocol was initiated with Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy with ABThera (KCI) in the need for a ""second look"" surgery. Forty-eight hours later, the rectal stump was found necrotic and a rectal resection on the superior third of rectum was perfomed.
Microscopically examination revealed areas of transmural necrosis in sigmoid colon and rectal stump of heterogeneous distribution and acute peritonitis with small basophilic angulated crystals embedded in the mucosa (Fig. 3). There was no evidence of recent vascular thrombosis. The final diagnosis was colonic necrosis due to CPS associated with hypertonic cathartic use.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4643456/,3,images/PMC4/PMC464/PMC4643456_01
PMC2721503_01,PMC2721503,Male,52.0,"A 52-year-old male presented with complaints of straining during micturition for two years, with poor stream of urine and burning micturition on and off. There was no history of hematuria, pyuria or retention of urine. Systemic systems were not present. On examination, suprapubic lump was palpable, more on the right side. On cystoscopy, a large solid tumor arising from just above the bladder neck along the right lateral wall, going anteriorly was seen. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large encapsulated intravesical mass [Figure 1]. There was no obvious extravesical extension. The radiological features were suggestive of a benign etiology, which could represent a mesenchymal tumor. Needle biopsy was performed followed by excision of the tumor. During surgery, an infraumbilical midline incision was taken, with an extraperitoneal approach. The tumor was palpated and bladder opened just lateral to the tumor on the anterior surface. Mucosa over the tumor was incised and a plane was developed. The tumor was freed from all mucosal attachments and enucleated. Pedicle of the tumor was transfixed and tumor was delivered.
Histology of the biopsy revealed a neoplasm composed of neoplastic cells with uniform oval to spindled nuclei arranged in a striking storiform pattern [Figure 2]. There was no evidence of necrosis, mitotic activity or nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical stain with vimentin was strongly positive. Cytokeratin, smooth muscle actin, S-100 and desmin was negative. A diagnosis of a mesenchymal tumor, possibly benign was offered at this stage, since th amount of tissue studied was small. Subsequently, the excised specimen was received. Grossly, the tumor measured 13 x 10 x 9 cm and weighed 600g [Figure 3]. It was well circumscribed with a smooth surface. Cut surface showed a firm, nodular, yellowish white appearance. Histology revealed features as seen in the needle biopsy specimen. There was no evidence of nuclear atypia or mitotic activity in multiple sections studied [Figure 4]. The final diagnosis was benign fibrous histiocytoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2721503/,2,images/PMC2/PMC272/PMC2721503_01
PMC4533358_01,PMC4533358,Male,17.0,"This 17-year-old boy was re-admitted due to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of the near-rupture of a recurrent dermoid cyst in the left cavernous sinus. Four years earlier, he had presented with left ptosis, diplopia, and left facial pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan acquired at that time revealed a hypodense round mass lesion in the left cavernous sinus (Fig. 2A). The mass lesion was hyperintense on T1- and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images; it was not contrast enhanced (Fig. 2B). Characteristically, the hyperintense area on T1-weighted images was suppressed on fat-suppression MRI images (Fig. 2C). The preoperative diagnosis was dermoid tumor and he underwent operation by craniotomy. The lesion was resected subtotally via the pterional approach. The white sebaceous cyst content containing hairs was removed (Fig. 2D). As pathological study showed squamous epithelium and hairs the final diagnosis was dermoid cyst (Fig. 2E). Postoperative T1-weighted MRI confirmed resection of the hyperintense mass lesion (Fig. 2F) and his symptoms disappeared soon after the operation.
Subsequent CT and MRI studies performed in the course of 4 years revealed a gradually-growing hyperintense lesion in the removal cavity that took on a dumbbell shape. Although he remained asymptomatic, he underwent repeat surgery to avoid rupture of the dermoid cyst into the subarachnoid space.
Before the second surgery, we performed CT and MRI studies to plan a safe operation. The dermoid cyst was located in the left cavernous sinus; the left carotid siphon was slightly extended by the tumor which partially faced the sphenoid sinus covered by the dura and by bone at the skull base (Fig. 2G-H). We selected ETSS for its lesser invasiveness and used a neuronavigation system (Stealth Station Pro, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) and an ICG endoscope to detect the fine edge of the ICA, the pituitary gland and the tumor mass, and to confirm patency of the cavernous sinus.
ETSS was started as in pituitary surgery through the bilateral nostrils. The dura mater around the sellar floor was exposed, and the cavernous sinus predominantly on the left side was detected with the assistance of navigation (Fig. 3A-B). To identify the fine edge of the left ICA and to confirm patency of the cavernous sinus, we injected 5 ml of ICG (25 mg dissolved in 10 ml of sterile water) into a peripheral vein after changing to the ICG endoscope system (Fig. 1A, lower). The fluorescence signals from flowing ICG in the left ICA were seen to pass through the dura and the bone that partially covered the ICA (Fig. 3B, E, I). A few seconds later, the patent cavernous sinus was identified (Fig. 3F, J, and G, K). The mucosa covering the clivus showed fluorescent signals (Fig. 3G, K). The normal pituitary gland became gradually visible more than 30 seconds after ICA detection (Fig. 3H, L). The low fluorescent signal from the dermoid cyst in the cavernous sinus was slightly increased through the dura (Fig. 3H, L).
We next cut the dura, taking care to protect the ICA and the patent cavernous sinus, and evacuated the cystic fluid whose consistency was like that of motor oil (Fig. 3C). There was slight bleeding from the re-opened cavernous sinus due to decompression of a part of the cavernous sinus. Soon thereafter cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) started to leak through the window of the dural incision because the wall of the dermoid cyst in the subarachnoid space was breached. The base of the brain surface was detected endoscopically from the window in the dura. To prevent CSF leakage, after sealing the dural incision with fat and a pedicle mucosal flap, we sprayed the area with fibrin glue. Finally, a sinus balloon (Fuji Systems Co., Tokyo) was inflated to compress the operation site.
Postoperative MRI scans showed no dermoid tumor in the cavity, and the patient was discharged 10 days after the operation without CSF leakage or any neurological deficits (Fig. 3D).
After operation, pictures of second-by-second intra-operative video recordings were exported to photoshop and the color values of the saved images were measured. Figure 4 shows the changes in the fluorescent signals. The time of first detection of ICG in the ICA was designated 0 second. The ICG signals in the ICA were sharply increased and they peaked at 5 seconds. Their intensity in the cavernous sinus rose to the same level at 10 seconds. The ICG signal peak was lower in the dermoid cyst than the ICA and the cavernous sinus. The signal intensity at the pituitary rose very slowly. At 30 seconds, the signals from the pituitary started to be higher compared to that of ICA and the cavernous sinus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4533358/,3,images/PMC4/PMC453/PMC4533358_01
PMC3204653_01,PMC3204653,Female,76.0,"A 76-year-old woman returned to Vancouver, Canada, in early 2010 after spending 3.5 months in northern India. Before her trip, she had been in good health. In India, persistent nonbloody diarrhea developed, for which she did not seek medical attention. One month later, she was treated in the hospital for hypertension and congestive heart failure. She was discharged 3 days after admission but readmitted 3 days later because of ongoing diarrhea and decreased consciousness. Unspecified encephalitis and a urinary tract infection were diagnosed, but despite antibacterial drug therapy, her neurologic status did not improve over the next 3 weeks. She was discharged from the hospital in India and transferred to Canada.
When she arrived at the hospital in Vancouver on February 14, 2010, her vital signs reflected distributive shock: temperature 38.3 C, blood pressure 100/80 mm Hg, and heart rate 126 beats/minute. Sepsis was suspected and she was given imipenem and vancomycin. Within 24 hours, her level of consciousness had deteriorated, and she was admitted to the intensive care unit and intubated for airway protection. Blood cultures were negative, but urine culture (>1 x 108 CFU/mL) grew highly drug-resistant K. pneumoniae N10-0469 (February 15, 2010) with intermediate resistance to chloramphenicol and susceptibility to colistin. The urine was packed with leukocytes, and no other source for sepsis was found. A perirectal sample, screened for resistant gram-negative rods, grew K. pneumoniae N10-0506 and E. coli N10-0505 (February 16, 2010). A stool specimen was negative for ova and parasites but positive for Clostridium difficile toxin.
The patient was given vancomycin and metronidazole for the C. difficile infection and colistin for the K. pneumoniae infection. Treatment with colistin was discontinued shortly after its initiation because of the onset of renal complications; treatment with chloramphenicol was successful. Test results for infectious causes of encephalitis (e.g., malaria smears, cerebrospinal fluid culture for bacteria, and staining for acid-fast bacteria and fungi) were negative, as were test results for cryptococcal antigen, herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, Japanese encephalitis virus, and rabies virus. Results of computed tomographic scans, magnetic resonance imaging of the head, and an electroencephalogram were suggestive of global metabolic encephalopathy. Neurologic symptoms did not improve, despite the successful treatment of the urinary tract infection. Subsequently, E. coli N10-0705 isolate with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype was obtained from urine on March 9, 2010, for which the patient was treated with imipenem.
Ventilator and vasopressor support were eventually removed, and the patient was transferred to the general medicine ward. Several days later, her condition worsened and she died; the final diagnosis was toxic metabolic leukoencephalopathy, probably related to sepsis. The patient's family refused to allow an autopsy.
Macrorestriction analysis of the 4 isolates showed that K. pneumoniae N10-0469 and N10-0506 were closely related, although E. coli N10-0505 and N10-0705 were not (Figure 1). All 4 isolates contained multiple plasmids (data not shown). beta-lactamase PCR and sequencing were conducted (primers listed in Table 1). K. pneumoniae N10-0469 and N10-0506 harbored the genes for SHV-1, CTX-M-15, OXA-1, CMY-6, and NDM-1; E. coli N10-0505 harbored TEM-1, CTX-M-15, CMY-6, and NDM-1; and E. coli N10-0705 harbored TEM-1, CTX-M-15, OXA-1, and CMY-42. The first characterized isolate from Sweden that harbored blaNDM-1 also harbored CMY-4, a Trp221Arg variant of the widespread CMY-2 beta-lactamase. CMY-6 is a Trp221Leu variant of CMY-2 (GenBank accession no. AJ011293). CMY-42 is a Val231Ser variant of CMY-2.
Antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing by Sensititer panels ESB1F and CMV1AGNF (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, OH, USA) found that all 4 isolates were multidrug resistant and that 3 of the 4 isolates, not E. coli N10-0705, were nonsusceptible to carbapenems (Table 2). Nonsusceptibility to carbapenems was also shown by Etest (bioMerieux, St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada) and disk diffusion (Table 2). K. pneumoniae N10-0469 and E. coli N10-0505 were susceptible to colistin, polymixin B, and tigecycline.
Multilocus sequence typing of K. pneumoniae N10-0469 showed that it was sequence type (ST) 16. The first characterized strain of K. pneumoniae that harbored NDM-1 was ST14, unrelated to ST16. Mutilocus sequence typing of E. coli N10-0505 showed it to be ST405. The worldwide spread of blaCTX-M-15 has been partly attributed to 2 epidemic strains, ST131 and ST405.
E. coli DH10B harboring NDM-1 plasmids was obtained by electrotransformation with whole plasmid DNA with selection on 0.25 mug/mL meropenem. Agarose gel analysis of transformants showed that they carried only a single, large plasmid. PCR and sequencing showed that CMY-6 and NDM-1 were located on an  102-kb plasmid (pNDM-Kp10469), originating from K. pneumoniae N10-0469, and on an  129-kb plasmid (pNDM-Ec10505), originating from E. coli N10-0505 (Figure 2). Incompatibility (Inc) group PCR and fingerprinting showed that both plasmids were related Inc A/C types, indicating possible horizontal transfer in vivo (Figure 2).
Transformant susceptibility to aztreonam is consistent with the inability of class B enzymes to efficiently hydrolyze this drug. Transformants exhibited lower carbapenem MICs than did clinical isolates, likely reflecting total beta-lactamase content and additional resistance mechanisms such as porin mutations in the clinical isolates (Table 2). The recent emergence of blaNDM-1 in India has been linked to its spread on the Inc A/C-type, IncF1/FII-type, or unknown plasmid types. Analysis for class 1 integron cassettes found that both plasmids contained a 0.8-kb cassette that coded for aac(6')-Ib-type aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyl transferase. PCR for the ISCR1 element associated with some class 1 integrons was negative.

Based on the histopathology of a previous tumor biopsy, the final diagnosis was Mullerian adenosarcoma of the cervix with a heterologous component.
Thoracic computed tomography did not identify any lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a polypoid lesion with heterogeneous T2 signal intensity with hyperintense signal predominance originating in the left side of the cervix. The lesion measured 59 x 64 x 60 mm (width x depth x length) and extended into and occupied the vaginal cavity (Fig. 1A and B). Retroperitoneal lymph nodes were not identified.
The patient was subsequently taken to surgery with a clinical preoperative diagnosis of Mullerian adenosarcoma of the cervix, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB2. Abdominal radical hysterectomy was performed along with resection of the left external iliac lymph nodes that were suspected for metastatic involvement during surgical exploration of the pelvic and para-aortic regions (Fig. 1C and D).
Histopathology revealed an exophytic, friable mass. Macroscopically, it appeared to originate in the cervical wall and protrude through the external cervical ostium, compromising the anterior and posterior aspects and the endocervical canal, with the uterine cavity free of lesions. Microscopically, the lesion was a Mullerian adenosarcoma of the cervix with stromal overgrowth greater than 25% and a heterologous component (cartilage and rhabdomyoblasts); the maximal tumor size was 7.5 cm in diameter (Fig. 2A and B).
The tumor exhibited CD10 focal positivity, S100 positivity in the cartilaginous component, myogenin positivity in the rhabdomyoblastic component, and cytokeratin cocktail and estrogen receptor positivity in the superficial epithelial and glandular components. The proliferation index as determined via Ki67 staining was 60% (Fig. 2C). Lymphovascular invasion was present; 1 left iliac lymph node displayed tumoral compromise (Fig. 2D), whereas parametrium and proliferative endometrium did not.
Adjuvant ifosfamide chemotherapy and pelvic radiotherapy plus high-dose intracavitary brachytherapy were recommended, but the patient refused owing to personal beliefs and having been asymptomatic after a successful postoperative course. She returned to our hospital 8 months after surgery with light bleeding and pelvic pain radiating to the lower right limb, for which we performed a complete physical exam and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine. We observed local and regional tumor regrowth in the form of an exophytic mass 6 cm in diameter originating in the vaginal vault (Fig. 3A). There was also a conglomeration of right pelvic lymph nodes, each 7 cm in diameter. These lesions were visualized clearly via PET-CT, as was a metastatic lesion in the right pubic ramus (Fig. 3B, C and D).
To treat the patient's pelvic recurrence and pelvic bone metastasis, external pelvic radiation (conformational technique) was delivered to the surgical site and margins in fractions of 2 Gy/day up to 50 Gy/day (planning target volume 1), with posterior reinforcement over the nodal conglomeration and vaginal vault until the total dose reached 60 Gy. High-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy of 2.1 Gy was also administered. After receiving 2.3 Gy of external pelvic radiation, the patient was once again asymptomatic, with a significantly improved clinical status and a 95% reduction in vaginal tumor volume (Fig. 4A). Owing to the excellent pelvic clinical response and the high functional status of the patient (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0), palliative chemotherapy consisting of ifosfamide and cisplatin was administered to manage the metastases.
MRI revealed osteolytic lesions with diffuse infiltration of the T11, T12, L1, and L2 vertebral bodies with a compression fracture of T12, left spinal infiltration, and medullary canal compromise (Fig. 4B and C). Hence, the patient received pelvic radiotherapy and conventional external radiotherapy at a total daily dose of 30 Gy in the thoracolumbar spine. The objectives of palliation were achieved, and there were no new signs of disease progression. A total of 21 months elapsed between surgery and the writing of this report.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5021815/,15,images/PMC5/PMC502/PMC5021815_01
PMC5697995_01,PMC5697995,Female,31.0,"31 years old lady presented to the breast surgery clinic with dimpling in the left breast, with no history of nipple discharge. The patient had regular menses, she denied any genetic familial history or family history of breast cancer or any other breast conditions, any previous breast procedures; including Aesthetic ones. No drug history including hormonal therapy. The patient's psychological status was optimum with no past history. No smoking history
On physical examination, a nodular density around 2 cm in the LOQ (lower outer quadrant) of the Lt (left) breast was noted, which was firm on palpation with irregular borders, no other lesions were noted in the same breast or in the other side. Bilateral axillary examination was unremarkable.
Ultrasound examination of the Lt breast showed a solid hypoechoic irregular vascularized nodule around 20 mm in size at the LOQ, with suspicious characteristic. Axillary examination of the same side documented the presence of ovular 9 mm lymph node with central hyperecogenisity and minimal cortical thickening. The report was staged as BIRADS 4C with a high suspicion of malignancy. MRI was done and showed background enhancement already evident in early phases that limits the diagnostic sensitivity. In the Lt breast at the UOQ (upper outer quadrant), a coarse distortion is noted about 23 x 10 mm which was suspicious. Noted as well at the OCQ (outer central quadrant) of the same breast a distortion of 15 mm with a doubt significance. At the Rt (right) breast, in the LOQ (lower outer quadrat), another suspicious area of distortion is documented, which was difficult to measure [Fig. 1].
FNA aspiration was done for the lesions noted at the Lt breast which shows negativity for malignant cells in the LOQ, staged C2 according to the European Guidelines - 1997. The same results were noted also at the LOQ lesion of the Rt breast (the lesion was also suspected in MRI). The FNA for the lesion in the OCQ of the Lt breast was inadequate for diagnosis, as well as those at the Lt axilla.
Giving the discrepancy between the suspicious findings in the US for the lesion noted in the LOQ of the Lt breast and the result of the FNA which was C2, a Core biopsy was performed, which revealed a proliferation of spindle cells of a fibroblastic type with slight atypia in a background of dense connective tissue. Embedded mammary ducts in apocrine metaplasia without atypia and microcalcifications. The lesion tended to be a mesenchymal one with an uncertain potential of malignancy, suggesting the need for surgical excision.
The patient after that underwent a surgical excision by a senior breast surgeon of the suspicious lesion which in the LOQ of the left breast. Intraoperative frozen section (Macroscopic Examination) for the lesion revealed a 2 cm nodule without signs of malignancy, compatible with a benign mesenchymal lesion. A radioguided excision of the other non palpable lesion in COQ of the same breast was done and sent for definitive histological exam. The patient tolerated the procedure well in day surgery and was discharged home in good condition with No post operative events.
The final histopathology for the LOQ lesion revealed; Proliferation of Spindle cells with a slight focal atypia in a background of dense connective tissue, [Fig. 2], immunophenptyping was positive for ACTIN of the smooth muscles, and focally for B-CATENIN, negative for CYTOKERATIN, DESMIN, CD34, CD99 & BCL-2.
Fibrocystic disease with non proliferative type with stromal fibrosis and apocrine metaplasia were the findings for the COQ lesion. So, the final diagnosis was Fibromatosis, which is a benign condition.
Then, the patient was reassured of the benignity of the lesion and was scheduled for close follow up.
After 3 months of follow up the patient presented for the reappearance of dimpling in the lower part of her Lt breast at the position of the previously excised lesion. And the patient reported episodes of pain as well at the same site.
Physical Examination showed a hard nodule, moderately mobile, with an overlying dimpling of the skin [Fig. 3, Fig. 4]. Repeated follow up ultrasound of the breast showed a hypoechogenic area with dyshaemogenic structure with a maximum diameter of 23 mm, the same characteristics of the previous lesion in the LOQ which was excised for a Fibromatosis [Fig. 5]. At the site of the excised lesion, there was another hypoechogeic area, with an irregular margin with the same characteristics of the previous lesion and a maximum diameter of 14 mm. A third lesion morphologically identical of that at the LOQ of the Rt Breast (previously documented in the MRI) about 17 mm which resulted previously to be C2 in the FNA. Bilateral Fibrocystic lesions. Axillary regions were clear. The stage of the US was BIRADS 3, a probably benign finding.
The patient was referred after that to a Sarcoma specialist for further evaluation, and repeated MRI was done, which showed in comparison with the previous one, that at the Rt breast two newly developed lesions about 5 mm & 5,5 mm in size respectively, with irregular margins and early and progressive enhancement which was suspicious (considering at that time the menstrual cycle of the patient). The same findings were found in a 5 mm lesion noted at the Lt UOQ of the other breast.
Again in the Rt breast at the LOQ, a distorted lesion around 20 mm with efigarly and persistent enhancement with the same characteristics of the previously excised fibromatosis. Meanwhile, a less distortion was evident at the site of the excised lesion at the Lt COQ of the left breast, while persisted particularly at the late signaling at a 24 mm lesion noted at the Lt LOQ adjacent to the surgical wound. The report of MRI was staged as BIRADS 3 with a benign probability.
Comparing the characteristics of the lesions in MRI with the previous histological exam and literature review, the diagnosis was made that of a recurrent Fibromatosis.
After that, a revaluation for the receptors status of ER, PR and Her-2 of the previously excised fibromatosis was made and resulted to be negative.
Giving the above all data and after the discussion with the sarcoma specialist and the reassurance of benignity noted in the follow up US, the decision was to follow up the patient in a 6 months period with a new MRI.
The patient was explained in details about her condition and the exclusion of malignancy in her case. She understood that her condition is a special kind of a disease that has a tendency to recur and she understands the need of a close follow up. The patient was happy to share her information in this case report for the sake of education and for other patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5697995/,8,images/PMC5/PMC569/PMC5697995_01
PMC5498214_01,PMC5498214,Female,48.0,"A previously healthy 48-year-old Japanese woman presented to the emergency department with severe pain in her dominant right hand and wrist. She worked as an office assistant but denied any blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand. She did not take any medications and had no animal contact. Fifteen hours prior, she described the gradual onset of a tingling sensation at the tips of the fingers along with mild clumsiness in her hand. She tried loxoprofen (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) without any improvement in her symptoms.
On an examination, her vital signs were normal, and the hand was noted to be held in a partially flexed position at the wrist (Fig. 1). The skin of the volar aspect of the right wrist appeared red and edematous. The radial and ulnar artery pulses were palpable, and the capillary refill time was normal. A neurological examination revealed subjective hypoesthesia in all five fingers with positive Tinel and Phalen tests. Plain wrist radiographs were unremarkable, but an unenhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the wrist demonstrated edematous changes around the digital flexor tendons within the wrist (Fig. 2). Laboratory studies were consistent with an acute infectious or inflammatory process with a white blood cell count of 11,000/muL with 87% neutrophils. Over the ensuing two hours, the patient's pain and edema rapidly worsened, and the erythema began to extend up her arm. Due to the rapid progression and pain out of proportion, an emergent surgical consultation was obtained for possible necrotizing fasciitis. In addition to necrotizing fasciitis, the surgery team was also concerned about pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, and she was taken promptly to the operating room.
The intraoperative findings revealed a blood-stained purulent exudate as well as edematous changes within the common flexor tendon sheath (ulnar bursa) with secondary median nerve compression but no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis. The ulnar bursa was incised, debrided, and irrigated with saline and an external drainage catheter was placed. Two sets of blood cultures failed to grow any organisms, but a Gram stain of the exudate showed the presence of Gram-positive cocci, subsequently identified as penicillin-resistant but methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Preoperatively, she received meropenem, vancomycin and clindamycin and the antibiotic coverage was narrowed to first-generation cephalosporin based on the microbiological susceptibility pattern. She had an uncomplicated postoperative course, and antibiotic treatment was continued for 20 days. At her two-month follow-up, she had almost completely regained the motor and sensory function in the hand. The final diagnosis was acute carpal tunnel syndrome secondary to pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5498214/,2,images/PMC5/PMC549/PMC5498214_01
PMC5322208_01,PMC5322208,Female,38.0,"A 38-year-old woman presented with a painless midline neck mass for 3 years. She had no associated symptoms and no history of previous neck irradiation. She was clinically euthyroid. Examination revealed a 2 x 2 cm cystic mass in the thyrohyoid area. The palpable thyroid gland was unremarkable. Preoperative ultrasound revealed a 1.8 x 2.4 cm cystic mass with septation and a solid mural component with microcalcification (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). A 4 mm right thyroid nodule was also detected (Fig. 3) and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. A fine needle aspiration biopsy without imaging guidance was carried out and yielded a nondiagnostic result. Sistrunk's operation was performed and the pathological report was a 1.4 cm papillary thyroid carcinoma in the benign cyst. A primary carcinoma arising in the TGDC is suggestive due to the presence of a thick fibrous wall with squamous epithelium and normal follicular cells. Lymphovascular invasion and a close surgical margin were reported. The patient was informed for a total thyroidectomy due to the pathological results and the right lobe lesion. Pathological report of the thyroid was a 4 mm papillary carcinoma with partial invasion through the thyroid capsule of the right lobe with a second 1 mm papillary carcinoma at the isthmus. The final diagnosis was a primary carcinoma arising in the TGDC with multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma. Radioactive iodine ablation was then administered. At the 12 month follow up involving clinical examination, cervical ultrasound and radioactive iodine whole body scan there was no evidence of any recurrent disease. The thyroglobulin and antithyroglobulin antibody levels were <0.2 ng/mL and <20 IU/mL respectively. The patient has been taking synthetic thyroid hormone with a thyroid stimulating hormone level of 0.5 mU/L.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5322208/,2,images/PMC5/PMC532/PMC5322208_01
PMC4881275_01,PMC4881275,Female,32.0,"A 32-year-old female presented to our hospital with a tumor on the left lumbar region. She had no personal or family history of skin cancer. The lesion of concern was an erythematous and focal eccentric pigmented nodule of 15 mm in diameter (fig. 1a). The clinical appearance of the lesion raised a suspicion of malignancy, and surgical resection was performed.
The surgically resected specimen showed a nodule with focally pigmented areas, and the cut surface of the nodule was asymmetrical and not ulcerated. Histological examinations showed a skin fragment with nearly complete effacement by foamy cells and asymmetry (fig. 1b). The foamy cells in the superficial dermis extended to the fatty tissue to a depth of 10 mm. Nuclear atypia and mitosis were scarcely displayed (fig. 1c). The intraepidermal component was composed of both nested and single atypical melanocytes with areas of intraepidermal pagetoid spread (fig. 1d). Fontana-Masson staining of the balloon cell component was negative (fig. 2a). An immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the balloon cells were positive with HMB-45 (fig. 2b) and S-100 protein (fig. 2c) and negative with cytokeratin. Staining with Ki-67 was positive in almost 44% of the foamy cells (fig. 2d). The pathological diagnosis was of BCMM (Breslow depth 10 mm, Clark level V) without ulcer.
A month after the excision, the patient presented with enlarged bilateral inguinal lymph nodes. The excised bilateral inguinal lymph nodes showed diffuse replacement of the lymph nodes by foamy cells (fig. 1e, f). These cells resembled those of the primary lesion. The diagnosis of a metastatic BCMM in bilateral inguinal lymph nodes was made. The final diagnosis was of Stage IIIB (T4a, N2b, M0). She received additional local excision, but not chemotherapies on her request.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4881275/,4,images/PMC4/PMC488/PMC4881275_01
PMC6624786_01,PMC6624786,Male,6.0,"A 6 years old, neutered male Lhasa Apso was presented with a 1 month history of progressive gait dysfunction characterized by the owner as an ""army crawling"" appearance. The dog's initial clinical presentation included a low head carriage, ataxia of all limbs, and suspected cervical hyperpathia. The cervical hyperpathia and ataxia resolved with a 2 weeks course of treatment with carprofen and cage rest, but over the subsequent weeks the gait evolved into what the owner described as ""army crawl"" (Supplementary Video 1).
Significant physical examination abnormalities were limited to the nervous system. The dog was ambulatory but tetraparetic, with weakness in the thoracic limbs more severe than in the pelvic limbs. Thoracic limb weight bearing occurred on the antebrachii. Thoracic limb postural reaction deficits and paresis were present and associated with reduced thoracic limb muscle tone, flexor withdrawal, and triceps reflexes bilaterally. Pelvic limb proprioception and postural reactions were delayed in the left pelvic limb and normal in the right pelvic limb. The pelvic limb spinal reflexes were intact. No apparent cervical hyperpathia was observed. Moderate muscle atrophy was present in the thoracic limbs. Neuroanatomic diagnoses included C6-T2 myelopathy with central cord component or bilateral brachial plexus neuropathy.
The dog was anesthetized and electromyographic (EMG) examination of the left cervical region and forelimb and an MRI of the cervical vertebral column were performed. Increased insertional activity, fibrillation potentials, and positive sharp waves were identified on EMG of the left triceps, biceps brachii, extensor carpi radialis, and supraspinatus muscles. No abnormal EMG findings were noted in muscles of the head, thoracolumbar epaxial region, or left pelvic limb. The MRI revealed extradural T2W hypointense material in the ventral vertebral canal overlying the C6-C7 disc space consistent with IVDH resulting in moderate ventral and left-sided extradural compression and dorsal displacement of the spinal cord. On sagittal T2W and STIR images, a well-defined, linear intramedullary hyperintensity was identified that extended from C5 to the cranial aspect of C7. On transverse T2W (Figure 1B) and FLAIR images, the hyperintensities were bilaterally symmetric and restricted to the ventral gray matter. These hyperintensities were isointense on T1W images and non-enhancing following IV gadolinium administration. The neuroradiological diagnosis was C6-C7 intervertebral disc extrusion with associated mutisegmental ISC. The distribution of the ISC was interpreted as compatible with a bilateral ventral horn lesion, with an SEM-like phenotype as described in humans. Differential diagnoses for the observed ISC included cavitations, edema, gliosis, and necrosis.
Ventral slot decompression was performed at C6-C7. The dog was discharged to the care of the owner 2 days after surgery with no change in its neurological status. An examination performed 2 weeks later revealed worsening thoracic limb paresis and muscle atrophy. A computed tomographic scan of the cervical spine revealed no residual extradural compression at C6-C7 or other complications associated with the ventral slot procedure. A physical therapy program was initiated. Despite rehabilitation, thoracic limb motor function gradually declined over the subsequent 4 weeks at which point the dog was euthanized when non-ambulatory from thoracic limb paralysis. A necropsy was performed.
On gross examination, there was no evidence of extruded intervertebral disc material in the vertebral canal, and a ventral slot defect filled with fibrous tissue was present at C6-C7. Bilateral cavitary lesions (Figure 1C) involving ventral horn gray matter was observed extending from the cranial aspect of the C5 through the C8 spinal cord segments. On microscopic examination, the lesions were somewhat symmetric in appearance and restricted to laminae VI-IX of the gray matter, but were most severe within the C5-C7 spinal cord segments. Cavitary regions in gray matter, which were most conspicuous in lamina VI, the central aspect of lamina VII and the dorsomedial aspect of lamina VIII, contained cellular processes, gitter cells, astrogliosis, faintly eosinophilic and shrunken ghost neurons lacking nuclear staining, and rare chromatolytic neurons. Neurons in the lateral portions of laminae VII, central portion of lamina VIII, and in laminae IX displayed acidophilic neuronal necrosis characterized by shrunken, angular and hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, and nuclear pyknosis. No fibrocartilaginous emboli were detected with Alcian blue staining. The final diagnosis was regionally extensive, bilaterally symmetric, chronic gray matter necrosis in spinal cord segments C5-C8 resulting in neurogenic thoracic limb muscular atrophy and fibrosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6624786/,3,images/PMC6/PMC662/PMC6624786_01
PMC6624786_02,PMC6624786,Male,8.0,"An 8 years old, neutered male mixed breed dog was evaluated for a 3 days history of cervical hyperpathia and right hemiparesis that progressed to tetraplegia. Upon presentation, the dog was tetraplegic with absent postural reactions in all limbs, diminished muscle tone and hyporeflexia in the thoracic limbs, and pelvic limb spasticity and hyperreflexia. Cervical hyperpathia was apparent on flexion of the neck. The neuroanatomic diagnosis was C6-T2 myelopathy.
An MRI of the cervical spine was performed under general anesthesia, the results of which were consistent with C5-C6 IVDH with associated compressive extradural hemorrhage (Figures 2A,B). No abnormal changes were observed within the spinal cord parenchyma. Ventral slot decompression was performed at C5-C6. The dog was ambulatory with pelvic limb ataxia when it was discharged to the owner 3 days after surgery.
Seven days after surgery, the dog represented non-ambulatory with severe lower motor neuron paresis and muscle atrophy in the thoracic limbs, with the pelvic limbs being neurologically intact. A cervical MRI examination was repeated and complete resolution of the previously identified extradural compression at C5-C6 was noted. However, contrast-enhancing ISC with an SEM-like phenotype was observed (Figures 2C-F), and subacute reperfusion injury, intramedullary hemorrhage, edema, myelitis, or infarction considered possible etiologies for the imaging abnormalities. Lumbar CSF analysis revealed albuminocytologic dissociation (total protein 101 mg/dl; reference range <45 mg/dl). CBC, indirect blood pressure, buccal mucosal bleeding time, and coagulation profile were within reference ranges. The dog underwent physical therapy and treatment with prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/day PO for 10 days) but remained non-ambulatory. Thoracic limb motor function and muscle mass declined insidiously and the dog was euthanized and a necropsy performed 3 months after surgery. Pathological findings in the gray matter were similar to those described for Case 1, except that at the junction of the ventral and intermediate gray horns with white matter, vacuolization of the white matter associated with variable axonal swelling was observed (Figure 2G). The final diagnosis was multisegmental, bilaterally symmetric, chronic gray matter necrosis, spinal cord segments C5-C8.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6624786/,7,images/PMC6/PMC662/PMC6624786_02
PMC4906136_01,PMC4906136,Male,78.0,"A previously healthy 78-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital because of epigastric pain and fever. Over the previous month, he had unintentionally lost 4.0 kg in weight. Physical examination showed no evidence of abdominal tenderness or a palpable mass. Laboratory examination showed anemia (hemoglobin, 10.3 g/dl) and elevated serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 1876 IU/l, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP; 373 IU/l), lipase (87 IU/l), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 77 IU/l), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 117 IU/l). His total bilirubin concentration was 0.7 mg/dl, his carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) concentration was 5.3 U/ml (normal <37.0 U/ml) and his carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration was 1.5 ng/ml (normal < 5.0 ng/ml). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) showed an approximately 2.6 x 1.5 cm mass at the duodenal papilla, enhanced in the arterial phase but washed-out in the venous phase (Fig. 1a). There was no evidence of lymph node metastasis or invasion of the common bile duct or pancreatic duct. Duodenoscopy revealed a smooth red protruding mass compressing the orifice of the papilla of Vater, making endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography difficult (Fig. 2). Endoscopic ultrasonography showed dilation of the pancreatic duct and common bile duct. A biopsy of the mass showed proliferation of osteoclast-like giant cells. Follow-up CECT 1 month later showed enlargement of the tumor, to 3.8 x 2.7 mm (Fig. 1b). Therefore, we performed subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (SSPPD) with regional lymphadenectomy.
Macroscopic examination of the duodenum showed a protruding mass, measuring 50 x 40 x 35 mm, located in the periampulla of the duodenum (Fig. 3a). Microscopically, the tumor was found to originate from the terminal segment of the common bile duct in the ampullary region (Fig. 3b). The area of the tumor protruding into the duodenum consisted of sheets of anaplastic round and ovoid giant cells or fascicles of spindle cells mixed with multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells. The former cells were negative for epithelial membrane markers like AE1/AE3, EMA and negative for CD68 while the later cells were negative for AE1/AE3, EMA and positive for CD68 (Fig. 3c). Carcinoma in situ (BilIN 3) was also observed, spreading from the terminal segment of the common bile duct to the common hepatic duct and the cystic duct. The surgical margin of the common hepatic duct was positive (Fig. 3d). There was no evidence of lymph node metastasis, lymphatic or vascular invasion, or invasion to the pancreas, pancreatic duct, or duodenum. The final diagnosis was UC-OGCs of the ampullary region, with the tumor staged as T1, N0, M0, stage IA according to the TNM staging system.
Twelve days after surgery, the patient was discharged from hospital without any complications. One year after surgery, the patient remains alive, with follow-up abdominal CT scan showing no evidence of tumor recurrence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4906136/,3,images/PMC4/PMC490/PMC4906136_01
PMC7879215_01,PMC7879215,Male,7.0,"A seven-year-old healthy boy presented to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic with a chief complaint of painful, slowly growing lower jaw swellings on both right and left sides. The patient had no past medical, surgical, or dental history. His guardian reported no known drug and food allergies. The guardian also denied having family history of genetic related diseases or syndromes. The swellings caused esthetic disfiguring of the patient's face, which led to social exclusion.
On examination, extraoral, bilateral asymmetric swellings of the lower part of the face with no lymph node involvement were noted. Intraorally, painful bilateral, hard, bony mandibular swellings covered with normal color mucosa, extending from the mesial aspect of the mandibular second primary molars on both sides including the retromolar areas, was observed. On palpation, the affected site revealed expansion of the buccal cortical plates on both sides. Both mandibular permanent first molars were not clinically erupted.
A diagnostic panoramic radiograph was taken which illustrated bilateral, well-defined radiolucencies surrounded by sclerotic margins and including the unerupted incomplete permanent mandibular first molars (36 and 46, according to the FDI World Dental Federation Notation). The panoramic image showing right radiolucency measured around 1 cm in its greatest dimension, and involved the unerupted permanent mandibular first molar (46, according to the FDI World Dental Federation Notation), and not involving the inferior mandibular cortical bone and the adjacent areas. On the other hand, the left radiolucency measured around 3cm in its greatest dimension, and involved the unerupted permanent mandibular first molar (36, according to the FDI World Dental Federation Notation), the inferior mandibular cortical bone and the adjacent areas. Moreover, the left radiolucent cyst distally displaced the permanent mandibular second molar tooth bud (37, according to the FDI World Dental Federation Notation) ( Figure 1). Provisional diagnosis of the bilateral lesions suggested bilateral BBC, dentigerous cyst, and paradental cyst.
The guardian was informed about the patient's condition, possible management and complications. Then, a consent form was signed before starting the complete surgical removal of the lesions under general anesthesia. An incision was made, then a buccal mucoperiosteal flap was raised in the mandible at the mandibular permanent first molar area on both right and left sides to expose the bone. The buccal plate was expanded and thinned; especially in the left side. An access to the cyst area was made by performing an ostectomy on both sides. The whole cyst lining was removed with the attached mandibular first molars. Then, the cavity was enucleated and curetted thoroughly ( Figure 2), to reduce the risk of recurrence. The patient was prescribed Ibuprofen 100 mg/5 mL oral suspension four times/day for 3 days in order to reduce the post-surgical pain.
The specimens were sent to the histopathology laboratory in two containers. The histopathologic analysis of the multiple serial sections of the two specimens revealed multiple pieces of cyst wall lined by small strip of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium with mixed inflammatory reaction and surrounding edematous granulation tissue formed of numerous proliferating capillary type vascular spaces. Also, the specimens under the microscope showed bland looking spindle-shaped fibroblasts and degenerated bony spicules, which was consistent with cystic lesions ( Figure 3). Based on the clinical examination, radiographic interpretation, and histopathologic analysis, the final diagnosis was bilateral BBC.
Six months later, the clinical and radiographic examination of both surgery sites showed signs of gradual healing and resolution and increased bone density in the areas. One year later, no clinical evidence of lesion recurrence, and radiographic imaging illustrated that the affected areas were completely filled up with bone.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7879215/,2,images/PMC7/PMC787/PMC7879215_01

By opening the liliequist membrane, the posterior communicating artery was followed to the interpeduncular fossa. Firm dark pink global tumor with a compressive effect on the mesencephalic area appeared. The third nerve ran into the tumor [Figure 3a]. Attempts to separate the tumor from the nerve were seemingly impossible because the tumor was adhesive and appeared to be rising from the oculomotor nerve. Complete paralysis of the third nerve on preoperative examinations indicated neural, and tumor fibers had been intertwined. Therefore, the surgeon considered the complete resection of the tumor as the best option for the patient and the tumor, together with the involved part of the oculomotor nerve, was resected [Figure 3b].
The histopathological study of the 10 x 5 x 4 mm dark pink mass revealed round to oval centrally located nuclei with dispersed chromatin and eosinophilic cytoplasmic. Lobules of the tumor are separated from each other with collagen sheets and contained whorls and psammoma bodies. Necrosis was not a feature. The final diagnosis was meningothelial meningioma (WHO Grade I).
On postoperative examination, all preoperative signs were found as complete paralysis of the left oculomotor nerve without slight responses and reflexes, which was expected due to the tumor and nerve resection. At a 6-month follow-up, she continued to have diplopia and eyelid drooping. In the brain MRI finding, there was no evidence of recurrence during 1 year follow-up.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7568104/,5,images/PMC7/PMC756/PMC7568104_01
PMC6476904_01,PMC6476904,Female,9.0,"A 9-years-old spayed female mixed-breed dog was referred for the evaluation of moderate neurological signs. It tended to seek narrow places, experienced body tremors, and had lost its vision 6 months before the referral, although its eyesight had been weakening since 2 years. The owner was provided detailed information on the diagnostic and surgical procedures required, and consent was also obtained. A bilateral menace response was absent on neurological examination, with no other abnormalities. Normal findings were obtained on performing echocardiography and abdominal ultrasound. The left and right adrenal glands measured 56 and 57 mm in length, respectively. Minimal increase in alanine aminotransferase (312 IU/L; reference, 5-60), gamma glutamyltransferase (64 U/L; reference, >9 U/L), and lipase (521 U/L; reference, 24-108) levels, and a moderate increase in the alkaline phosphatase (973 U/L; reference, <280) level was observed on complete blood count, a chemistry panel, and urinalysis. The thyroxine (T4) level was slightly decreased (13.6 nmol/l; reference, 17-54). MRI and computed tomography were recommended for further assessments.
Following intravenous cannulation, the dog was anesthetized using propofol injection (5 mg/kg body weight [bwkg]; Narcofol , CP-Pharma GmbH, Burgdorf, Germany). After intubation, anesthesia was maintained with a mixture of isoflurane and oxygen gas (Forene , AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, Wiesbaden, Germany; 1.5% volume/volume; oxygen flow, 2 1/min). MRI was performed using a 1.5-T device (Siemens Magnetom Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) to acquire the following sequences: T2W images in the transverse (echo time [TE]/repetition time [TR], 112/4,220 ms; slice thickness [SL], 3 mm), sagittal (TE/TR, 112/3,500 ms; SL, 3 mm), and dorsal (TE/TR, 112/3,500 ms; SL, 3 mm) planes; thin-slice native images (TE/TR, 9.1/550 ms; SL, 2.5 mm); fat-suppressed images (TE/TR, 9.1/749 ms; SL, 0.9 mm); post-contrast images (0.2 mL/bwkg; Dotarem 0.05 mmol/l injection, Guerbet, Villepinte, France); T1W three-dimensional images (magnetization prepared rapid gradient-echo) in the sagittal, transverse, and dorsal planes; and time-of-flight angiography (TE/TR, 7/25 ms; SL, 0.7 mm). The field of view was 170 x 170 mm.
During the same session, native, and post-contrast computed tomography images of the brain were obtained using an inner ear (SL, 1.0 mm; kernel, H60s; SL, 0.75 mm; kernel, H70h) and carotid angio (SL, 2.0 mm; kernel, B30f; SL, 0.6 mm; kernel, B26f) protocol, followed by maximum intensity projection reconstructions in the dorsal plane.
An intra- and suprasellar mass was observed on MRI (Figure 1). The intrasellar portion appeared iso- and hyperintense on T2W images, and hyper- and hypointense on T1W images, with marked contrast enhancement along the dura mater. A multicompartmental cyst-like component was attached to the mass; this component showed T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity, and compressed the thalamus and pons in the caudal direction. The optic chiasma was also compressed in the cranioventral direction. The cystic structure showed late enhancement, particularly in the fluid-filled areas. The size of the cyst was 16 x 18 x 14 mm. The radiological diagnosis was an intra- and suprasellar lesion connected to a multicompartmental fluid field. Differential diagnoses included suprasellar arachnoid cyst, epidermoid cyst, craniopharyngioma of the pituitary gland, and myxomatous tumors.
Preoperative three-dimensional planning was performed using MeshMixer (AutoDesk, Inc., San Rafael, CA, USA) and Amira for LifeSciences 6.0 software (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for identification of the landmarks for the surgical approach, and measurement of the exact volume and extension of the lesion. During surgery, the dog was placed in sternal recumbency, and its mouth was held open with a special equipment. Videoendoscopy was used for better visualization (Karl-Storz 2.7 mm 30  optic kit, 6703BA, Tuttlingen, Germany). Fentanyl (5 mug/bwkg; Richter Gedeon, Budapest, Hungary), dormicum (0.05 mg/bwkg; Egis Pharmaceuticals PLC, Budapest, Hungary), and ketamine (CP Ketamin 10% AUV; Medicus Partner, Hungary) were used as premedication before anesthesia induction using propofol (5.5 mg/bwkg; propofol 1% MCT/LCT; Fresenius Kabi AB, Bad Homburg, Germany). Anesthesia was maintained with a mixture of isoflurane and oxygen gas (Isoflutek 1,000 mg/g, 1.5% volume/volume; Laboratorios Karizoo SA, Barcelona, Spain). The buccal hair was removed, and the mouth area was disinfected using chlorhexidine (Curasept Chlorhex 30 mL, 0.5% spray, Curaden Swiss, Marleston, Australia). Subsequently, the soft palate was incised in the midline using an electrocautery device, and a hole was drilled into the basisphenoid bone according to the preoperatively determined landmarks. Under continuous endoscopic guidance, the hole was enlarged until the medial edges of both cavernous sinuses were visible around the pituitary gland. The cyst was drained and the entire pituitary gland was removed along with a part of the cyst wall. The opened third chamber was visible after complete gland removal. The bone defect was closed using a special bone reconstruction and anticoagulant sponge (Cerasorbe Foam; Curasan AG, Kleinostheim, Bayern, Bavaria, Germany), and the soft palate wound was closed with monofilament absorbable sutures (Surgicryl, SMI AG, Hunningen, Belgium).
During and 24 h after surgery, strict monitoring and tests were conducted at 1-h intervals. Examinations included measurement of the body temperature, blood pressure, acid-base status, electrolyte status, urine specific gravity and volume, heart and respiratory rates, blood lactate and glucose levels, and tear production. No abnormalities were noted.
Substitution therapy was initiated immediately after surgery. This included intramuscular hydrocortisone injections (Solu-Cortef 1 mg/bwkg TID; Pfizer, New York City, NY, USA) and desmopressin eye drops (Nocutil 0.1 mg/mL spray, one drop TID; Gebro Pharma GmbH, Fieberbrunn, Austria). A buprenorphine injection (Bupredine Multidose 0.3 mg/mL, 0.03 mg/bwkg; Produlab Pharma B.V., Raamsdonksveer, Netherlands) was administered every 6 h, while an amoxicillin-clavulanic acid injection (Augmentin 1000/200 mg, 20 mg/bwkg; GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Brentford, UK) was intravenously administered BID for 3 days. The surgery and the first post-operative day were uneventful.
One day after surgery, MRI was performed using the same 1.5-T scanner (Siemens) to acquire the following sequences: T2W fast spin echo images in the transverse (TE/TR, 83.3/3,920 ms; SL, 3 mm) and sagittal (TE/TR, 96.5/4,500 ms; SL, 3 mm) planes; T2W fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images in the dorsal plane (TE/TR, 127.4/8,002 ms; SL, 3 mm); T2W gradient recalled echo images in the horizontal plane (TE/TR, 20/620); T1-weighted spin echo images in the sagittal plane (TE/TR, 15/240 ms; SL, 2 mm); post-contrast images (0.2 mL/bwkg; Dotarem 0.05 mmol/l injection, Guerbet, Villepinte, France); and three-dimensional T1W images (magnetization prepared rapid gradient-echo) in the sagittal, transverse, and dorsal planes. The sella turcica and cyst were both empty, although the cyst walls showed contrast enhancement on post-contrast images (Figures 2A,B).
Cytological analysis of the surgical specimen indicated a high probability of a neuroendocrine or ependymal origin of the mass.
The presence of normal adenohypophyseal tissue was observed on histopathological analysis of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides; intact acidophilic, basophilic, and chromophobe cell populations; acute hypophyseal hyperemia; and dilatation of the intrahypophyseal vessels filled with erythrocytes. Immunohistochemical examination of the intact adenohypophyseal cells showed diffuse, intense, homogeneous cytoplasmic synaptophysin-positivity; multifocal, intense, homogeneous cytoplasmic pancytokeratin-positivity; and Ki-67-negativity. The intact endothelial cells in the intrahypophyseal vessels showed diffuse, intense, homogeneous, and membranous CD31-positivity.
No abnormalities were observed on neurological examination performed on the first post-operative day, and 2 days after hospitalization, the dog regained vision in both eyes.
Normal tear production was observed on Schirmer's test. The dog was discharged 3 days after surgery. Oral administration of prednisolone (Prednisolon-Richter 5 mg, 1 mg/kg BID; POS Richter Gedeon), desmopressin eye drops (one drop TID; Gebro Pharma GmbH), oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Synulox 250 mg BID; Zoetis, Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ, USA), and oral levothyroxine sodium (L-thyroxin Henning 100 mug, 15 mug/bwkg BID, Sanofi Aventis, Paris, France) were continued at home.
Blood and urine tests were repeated at 1, 5, 10, 20, and 25 days after surgery. Moderate increase in alanine aminotransferase (mean, 315 IU/L), gamma glutamyltransferase (mean, 71.7 IU/L), lipase (mean, 1,871 IU/L), and alkaline phosphatase (man, 1,173 U/L) levels was observed in complete blood count, a chemistry panel, and urinalysis. The T4 level slightly decreased (8.7 nmol/l) in the initial post-operative period, although it normalized by day 25 (20.2 nmol/l).
However, the dog presented with the same preoperative signs and symptoms 73 days after surgery, exhibiting obtundation and depression, and a tendency of seeking tight spaces again. No other problems were observed on neurological examination, and normal findings were obtained on thoracic radiography and abdominal ultrasound. Regrowth of the cyst to its original size was apparent on MRI, and was compressing the surrounding structures (Figures 2C,D). Because of the poor prognosis and worsening clinical signs, the owner requested euthanasia.
Macroscopically, the location of the cyst was accurately identified on the formalin-fixed brain ex situ (Figure 3). The wall of the intracerebral cyst consisted of a thin external layer of astrocytic glial tissue, as observed on histopathological analysis of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides prepared from the brain sample obtained during necropsy, and internal single and multifocally double layers of ciliated, cuboidal-to-flattened, ependyma-like cells. Positivity of the cyst wall for glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100 protein, and vimentin, and negativity for synaptophysin and epithelial membrane antigen was observed on immunohistochemical examination. Thus, the final diagnosis was ependymal cyst.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6476904/,1,images/PMC6/PMC647/PMC6476904_01
PMC6216069_01,PMC6216069,Female,36.0,"A 36 years old woman with a suspicious diagnosis of cervical carcinoma in a tertiary hospital several days before visited our hospital. The patient had a regular menstrual cycle. Her childbearing history was G4P1A3, and she gave the birth by cesarean section in 2005. She was diagnosed with hypertension for five years and took medicine regularly, with blood pressure being controlled in normal condition.
She complained about vaginal bleeding after copulation for Six months, accompanying with constipation, diameter-thinning stool and an increase of vaginal discharge. She also complained that she had a mild pain sometimes in the low back and pelvis, without obvious association with menstrual cycle. So she came to a tertiary hospital specialized in gynaecology and did some examination according to the doctor's advice. Pelvic ultrasound showed a 6.0 x 4.3 cm hysteromyoma and a 4.7 x 3.9 cm posterior cervical mass, with the ovaries found no abnormality. Enhanced pelvic computed tomography (CT) showed a 3.5 x 3.9 cm vaginal occupying lesion invading the rectum (Fig. 1) and a 5.8 x 4.7 x 5.3 cm hysteromyoma. The doctor gave a suspicious diagnosis of cervical carcinoma.
Then the patient came to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. Additional examination was done. Examination of tumor markers showed that the serum level of CA125 was 87.9U/ml, 2.5 times of the normal upper limit, with squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), CEA and CA199 within the range of normal value. Physical exam found that cervix uterus was thickened, with irregular shape and locally Protruding nodules. Vaginal and cervical biopsy only showed chronic inflammation. Colonoscopy examination found a mass at the rectum 4 cm from the anus (Fig. 2) and biopsy indicated spindle-cell-like mesenchyma-derived tumor, with the immunohistochemical result not supporting the diagnosis of interstitialoma. Supplementary PET-CT examination showed an increase of 18FDG uptake of the rectal mass (Fig. 3), with the standardized uptake value(SUV) as 4.7. PET-CT reported that it was a submucous tumor, with interstitialoma being suspicious. Then another biopsy examination of the rectum mass was done and the diagnosis result was rectal endometriosis supported by the immunohistochemical result.
Multidisciplinary team, including oncologists, surgical specialists, gynecologists and pathologists, was established to discuss the complex condition. The pathologist supported the diagnosis of rectal endometriosis according to the immunohistochemical result. All doctors shared a common thought that there is a possibility that both rectal carcinoma and rectal endometriosis were existent at the same time, taking the small insufficient biopsy specimen into account. If a radical operation was performed, treating it as a malignant tumor, considering that the rectal mass was only 4 cm away from the anal verge, the patient could not save the anal function, and colostomy would be existent permanently, reducing the quality of life. After a heated discussion, a consensus that partial resection should be operated to confirm the histopathological diagnosis and then to determine the further treatment was achieved. Eventually, the final diagnosis was confirmed as rectal endometriosis and gynecological management was suggested.
Thereafter, the patient was discharged, seeking medical treatment in a tertiary hospital specializing in Gynecology. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists was injected subcutaneously once per month for six months, with all the symptoms gradually disappeared. Then, a ring that slowly releases levonorgestrel was put into the uterine cavity, and it should be used until menopause according to the instruction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6216069/,1,images/PMC6/PMC621/PMC6216069_01
PMC10183181_01,PMC10183181,Male,48.0,"In July 2020, a 48-year-old male presented with a ""lung shadow of 1 week (1w) on physical examination"" at the Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, other hospital chest computed tomography (CT) results showed inflammatory lesions in the upper lobe of the right lung (exact report not available). The patient had no uncomfortable symptoms such as fever, cough, or hemoptysis, and thus he was given levofloxacin tablets as an anti-infection treatment. The results of the chest CT were re-examined after 10 days of treatment and revealed that mediastinal lymph nodes had calcification, the upper lobe of the right lung had a lamellar shadow with calcification, corresponding bronchial stenosis, and possibly chronic inflammatory lesions. The two lungs also had a few speckled and cord-like hyperdense shadows (Figure 1A and B). The patient had a history of hypertension, fatty liver, and abnormal liver function, with no history of glucocorticoids, cytotoxic drugs, or immunosuppressive therapy. Personal history: smoked 10 cigarettes per day for more than 20 years. 
He was admitted with a temperature of 36.8 C, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, a heart rate of 72 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 143/90 mmHg, and a body mass index (BMI) of 26.08 kg/m2. He was in a clear state of mind and had regular breath sounds in his lungs, no dry rales, and no pleural friction sounds on auscultation. Physical examination of the heart, abdomen, and peripheral vasculature revealed no obvious abnormalities. Immunoglobulin (Ig) and antibody results showed that IgG was 7.39 g/L  and complement protein C4 was 0.11 g/L . Biochemical results revealed that alanine transaminase was 63 U/L  and gamma-glutamyl transferase was 92 U/L . His routine blood test as well as other laboratory tests such as T, B, and natural killer lymphocyte subsets were normal. On the second day following admission, a bronchoscopy was performed. White pus was observed in the flushing of the right upper lobe lumen and a necrotic mass tissue was observed under a bronchoscope in the anterior portion of the right upper lobe (Figure 1C). The bronchial mucosa of the anterior segment of the right upper lobe was taken for pathological examination. Brushing and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) examinations were also performed. Pathological biopsy showed fungal hyphae with necrotic calcification, the morphology was more consistent with Aspergillus (Figure 1D and E), indicating broncholithiasis and right upper lobe invasive aspergillosis. The BALF galactomannan (BALF-GM) test result was 1.4 mug/L (positive), fungal culture for Aspergillus fumigatus was found, bacterial culture was normal bacterial growth, Mtb DNA and tuberculosis (TB) smear examinations were negative, and no malignant cells were observed. The brush test results were also normal. A diagnosis of broncholithiasis and Aspergillus infection was made in conjunction with the examination results, and the patient was treated with voriconazole 200 mg bid antifungal therapy. Treatment was continued with oral voriconazole after discharge from the hospital. The chest CT was taken at each of the six follow-up visits, and the results revealed that the inflammatory lesions had been completely absorbed. During this period, the patient had no clinical symptoms and was in good general health.
A secondary bronchoscopy was carried out in February 2021 to determine whether to discontinue antifungal medication after six months of treatment. The patient was no longer prescribed voriconazole after BALF-GM test results and accompanying pathogenic smear and culture examinations were negative. In February 2022, one year after the termination of the voriconazole, the patient underwent one more examination, and a CT scan showed bronchiectasis in the upper lobe of the right lung, in which nodules with calcification were observed, measuring about 3.1x1.7 cm, which was larger than before. A faint lamellar shadow was seen next to the right lung hilar, and therefore infection was considered. Multiple foci of calcification were seen in the right lung hilar, and calcified lymph nodes were seen in the mediastinum (Figure 2A). Because the patient had no subjective symptoms despite these findings, suggesting that his condition was progressing, a third bronchoscopy was carried out. A stone-like mass was discovered in the anterior section of the upper right lung on bronchoscopy (Figure 2B), and white pus was seen on flushing. Bronchoscopic stone extraction failed because the stone was firmly attached to the tracheal wall and could not be moved or totally detached. Mucosal biopsy pathology showed chronic inflammation of the mucosa with calcification (Figure 2C). BALF revealed that erythrocytes were >100/Hp, nucleated cells were 6-10/Hp, the neutrophil percentage was 92%, and fungal culture was negative, and the rest of the bacterial smear and bacterial culture results were not abnormal. The final diagnosis was as follows: (1) broncholithiasis and (2) obstructive pneumonia; hence, the patient was given cefixime for anti-infection. After a month, the chest CT was retested, and the results showed a good prognosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10183181/,1,images/PMC1/PMC101/PMC10183181_01
PMC4899933_01,PMC4899933,Male,56.0,"A 56-year-old man receiving prednisone for Wegener's granulomatosis presented with fever, confusion, and progressive weakness. Wegener's granulomatosis had been previously diagnosed with a temporal artery biopsy, which demonstrated neutrophilic infiltration of the vessel wall consistent with a necrotizing vasculitis. Serum studies and CSF (titer 1:4096) were positive for Cryptococcus neoformans with a normal opening pressure. Cytology and flow cytometry were negative for B cells, plasma cells, or malignant cells. The patient was treated with ambisone and flucytosine initially. He also had cavitating lesions in the lung, spleen, and liver consistent with disseminated cryptococcal infection.
For the next six to seven months, the patient was re-admitted to the hospital repeatedly due to intermittent recurring headaches. Serial MRIs demonstrated progressive development of new lesions in the basal ganglia, ventriculitis, and worsening leptomeningitis with associated cerebritis. The patient was weaned off prednisone. His persistent symptoms were thought to be due to immune reconstitution syndrome, given the combination of worsening imaging features and elevated lumbar-puncture opening pressure, in the setting of reduced CSF cryptococcal antigen and negative CSF cultures. He subsequently changed to fluconazole for treatment of his cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.
MRI with contrast (Fig. 1) obtained approximately seven months after first presentation demonstrated a nodular mass with meningeal enhancement and parenchymal edema adjacent to the right MCA trifurcation, and a slightly more medial mass adjacent to the left MCA. There was high-grade vessel narrowing seen on MRA (Fig. 2) in both vessels at the precise location of the enhancement. Moderate irregularity of the left proximal A1 segment, which was also involved with inflammatory disease, was also noted on the MRA. Abnormal enhancement of the ependyma and choroid plexi was present. No infarct was seen on DWI.
Biopsy of the right temporal lobe, performed approximately one month after the images shown were obtained, demonstrated active and chronic inflammation and numerous yeast forms, although no growth on culture media was observed. The final diagnosis was Cryptococcus neoformans infection.
The latest MRI, performed ten months after initial presentation (not shown), demonstrated stable subependymal nodules and a decrease in the extent of leptomeningeal enhancement, particularly in the Sylvian fissures. Grossly similar, persistent, unchanged high-grade vessel narrowing was seen on the repeated standard sequences (T2 and postcontrast T1), although repeat MRA was not performed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4899933/,4,images/PMC4/PMC489/PMC4899933_01

History revealed that the swelling had gradually increased in size since its onset. The swelling was not associated with pain, discharge or paraesthesia. The patient had noticed mobility of her lower right back teeth since 15 days.
On extra oral examination, a solitary, diffuse swelling was evident on the right mandibular body that was roughly oval; measuring 2.5 cm x 2 cm, and the surface appeared smooth. The skin was intact with no secondary changes. The swelling was nontender and hard.
Intraoral examination revealed a diffuse swelling in the mandibular right buccal vestibule, extending from the canine up to the first molar, measuring 2.5 x 1 cm in size. [Figure 1] The surface appeared smooth and the surrounding area normal. Lingual displacement of the first and second premolars was evident. On palpation, bicortical expansion was evident with an area of decortication at the region of the first molar on the buccal side. The swelling was hard except at the region of decortication. Grade II mobility of the premolars and first molar was evident. Aspiration of the lesion yielded scanty amount of frank blood.
The differential diagnosis for the lesion included odontogenic keratocyst, ameloblastoma, pindborg tumor, and nonodontogenic lesions such as central hemangioma, and central giant cell granuloma, as well as central malignancy such as an osteosarcoma.
Intra oral periapical radiograph showed a well-defined radiolucency extending from the distal margin of the first premolar root up to the mesial margin of the mesial root of first molar tooth, having a uniform internal density, with a sclerotic lining in the superior aspect. External root resorption and displacement of the first and second premolars and the first molar teeth was appreciated. Cross sectional occlusal radiograph showed bicortical expansion extending from the distal line angle of the canine up to the mesial aspect of the second molar tooth [Figure 2].
The panoramic radiograph showed a unilocular, well-circumscribed radiolucency, measuring approximately 3.5 x 4cm, extending from the distal margin of the canine up to the mesial margin of the mesial root of the second molar tooth [Figure 3].
The incisional biopsy specimen showed an unencapsulated lesion consisting of bundles of spindle cells in Antoni A and Antoni B zones arranged in a palisading pattern, interspersed with small hyaline structures, the Verocay bodies [Figure 4, Figure 5]. The histopathological diagnosis was that of a Schwannoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed with an S-100 marker, which showed diffuse positivity in the tumor cells [Figure 6], which further potentiated the diagnosis of Schwannoma.
Treatment encompassed segmental resection of the tumor, with reconstruction using autogenous iliac crest bone graft, under general anesthesia, at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery [Figure 7].

One year ago, the patient was diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer at a local hospital due to painless hematuria and underwent TURBT, followed by one cycle of first-line therapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin). The patient ceased chemotherapy due to adverse reactions to the drugs. On April 2, 2021, he presented at our hospital with a recurrence of painless hematuria, and a biopsy confirmed bladder cancer recurrence ( Figure 2A ). Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the expression of PD-L1 as well ( Figure 2B ), and wild-type FGFR3 was discovered by NGS. The patient underwent abdominal enhanced CT ( Figure 2C ), chest CT ( Figure 2D ), and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure F), which revealed several oval nodules of varying sizes and a maximum diameter of 1.7 cm in both lungs, as well as a round soft tissue density shadow (5.4 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm) toward the base of the bladder. The final diagnosis was stage IV bladder UC with multiple lung metastases.
The patient underwent two cycles of treatment with anlotinib (10 mg, d1-14) combined with tislelizumab (200 mg, three times per week). On May 18, 2021, a pelvic MRI revealed that the patient's tumor on top of the bladder was 5.0 x 4.2 x 5.0 cm.

Oral examination by a dentist revealed gingivitis, dental decay, very poor hygienic state and moderate amount of plaque and calculus. On chest examination, abnormal breathing sounds, such as crackle and expiratory wheezing, were not audible. There were no other physical abnormalities noted.
Laboratory examination showed the hemoglobin was 13.8 g/dL, hematocrit 40.4%, white blood cell 6,700/muL, platelet 177,000/muL. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 14 mm/h. C-reactive protein was 0.5 mg/dL. Cytologic examination of sputum was negative. Bacteriologic examination of sputum showed no evidence of mycobacterial tuberculosis or fungal infection. Chest radiographs revealed increased opacity and atelectatic change in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe, suggestive of obstructive pneumonitis or pulmonary tuberculosis (Figure 1A). A computed tomographic scan (CT) of the thorax showed consolidation and air bronchogram in the left upper lobe with partial atelectasis, but significant enlargement of mediastinal or hilar lymph node was not observed (Figure 1B). Bronchoscopic examination showed a pink and soft protruding mass obstructing the left upper lobar bronchus was suggestive of bronchogenic carcinoma (Figure 2A). The presumptive diagnosis by bronchoscopy was bronchogenic carcinoma. However, biopsy of the lung tissue obtained by bronchoscopy showed gram-positive sulfur granules and hyphe-like components within a granulomatous formation, which showed squamous metaplasia of bronchial mucosa with mixed inflammatory cellular infiltration and some colonies of actinomycosis (Figure 3). The final diagnosis was endobronchial actinomycosis.
The patient was given 10 million units of intravenous penicillin-G daily for two weeks. The opacities and infiltration on chest radiographs gradually decreased. After two weeks of penicillin therapy, he was switched to 2 g amoxicillin daily. At discharge, more than 80% of his pulmonary infiltration had resolved and the remainder was markedly reduced in size. After discharge, oral antibiotics were administered for 4 weeks. Follow-up bronchoscopic examination revealed a complete resolution of the endobronchial mass lesion and, in place, a foreign body was exposed (Figure 2B). The removed foreign body was proven to be a very small-sized fish bone. This unfortunate accident is the first case of a foreign body-induced pulmonary actinomycosis in Korea. The patient was completely cured with no remaining symptoms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4531673/,3,images/PMC4/PMC453/PMC4531673_01
PMC7191075_01,PMC7191075,Female,25.0,"A 25-year-old female came to our institution after noticing a rapid growing mass in her left breast for 16 weeks. She had no past medical histories and was at the week 25 of her first pregnancy. On examination, the patient was afebrile and there were two large masses on her left breast with diameters of 20 x 7 cm and 10 x 6 cm, which was ulcerated and bleeding (Fig. 1). A relatively fixed 2-cm lymph node in the left axilla was also noticed. On ultrasound, there were two heterogeneously echogenic lesions with irregular borders and fatty infiltrate, of which the diameters were about 10 cm and 20 cm respectively. Besides, several axillary lymph node with the largest diameter of 2 cm were found, but the fatty hilum was still present. The patient was anemic, with a hemoglobin level of 58 g/L.
Local dressing and pressure were applied to slow down the bleeding. Blood transfusion and prophylactic antibiotics were also indicated. The initial clinical diagnosis was cT4bN2M0 breast cancer. However, an open biopsy with local anesthesia was done which yielded the result of lactating adenoma of the breast. The tumor still significantly bled and palliative mastectomy was performed. During surgery, we found two large tumors which had unclear borders and spread to almost entire breast tissue but did not invade the pectoralis muscles.
On post-operative pathological examination, there were necrosis areas along with breast ductal hyperplasia. The epithelial cells exhibited secretory changes which had mildly hyperchromatic, round nuclei and prominent cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig. 2). The final diagnosis was then lactating adenoma. There were no post-operative complications, the axillary lymph nodes shrank gradually after antibiotic treatment and the patient was stably discharged two weeks later. The pregnancy then went well and she gave birth to a healthy girl after two months. After two years of follow-up, there have been no signs and symptoms of recurrence or metastasis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7191075/,1,images/PMC7/PMC719/PMC7191075_01
PMC5828291_01,PMC5828291,Female,11.0,"An 11-year-old white female patient was referred to the Stomatology clinic of the University of Sao Paulo, because of a painless nodular lesion on the palatal gingiva close to the incisive papilla. The nodule was sessile, smooth-surfaced, covered with normal colored mucosa, firm upon palpation and measured approximately 1.5 cm (Figure 1).
The patient reported that the lesion had grown slowly over 2 years. The clinical hypothesis included peripheral ossifying fibroma and peripheral giant cell granuloma, and the patient was submitted to an excisional biopsy. The absence of bone erosion was confirmed through radiographic examination and during surgery.
In the course of gross examination, a hard consistency was noticed and the specimen was sent to be decalcified. The microscopic analysis revealed the presence of a rounded lesion within the lamina propria composed of randomly arranged dental tissues (Figure 2A). The tissues were mostly young, and composed of tubular dentin, cementum-like material and loosely arranged mesenchymal cells resembling dental papilla. The mass contained odontoblast-like cells adjacent to the dentin, small islands of odontogenic epithelium and few basophilic areas interpreted as enamel matrix. Foci of ghost cells were also observed (Figure 2B). The final diagnosis was peripheral complex odontoma.
The surgery site healed uneventfully, and the patient remains lesion-free after one year.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5828291/,1,images/PMC5/PMC582/PMC5828291_01
PMC7306521_01,PMC7306521,Female,54.0,"A 54-year old woman, without any past medical history, who presented to the emergency department with sharp right upper quadrant abdominal pain progressing since a week. This pain was mainly localized in upper right side abdomen and has spread towards the right shoulder. It was associated, occasionally, with nausea but no vomiting. According to the patient, she had similar episodes of abdominal pain, several months before, but recently, this pain was increasing in frequency and severity.
On admission, her vital signs were normal with blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg and pulse rate of 75 beats per minute. The physical examination showed right upper quadrant tenderness with positive Murphy sign. But no fever (37, 5 ), jaundice or abdominal hernias were noted. Blood analysis found elevated white blood cells count (14,000/ mul) with negative C reactive protein (< 5). Total bilirubin level (1, 1 mg/dl), liver function (SGOT: 20UI/l, SGPT: 26UI/l) and lipase (120 UI/l) were negative.
The requested abdominal Ultrasonography revealed two separate gallbladders. Both gallbladders (A and B) were distended, with a thickened wall and a gallstone impacted in the infundibulum in the first gallbladder and a fundic gallstone in the second one (Fig. 1). Nearby, a multilocular collection in the hepatic segment IV was detected. On the basis of ultrasound findings and clinical symptoms, a lithiasic complicated cholecystitis on gallbladder duplication was made.
An abdominal Computed Tomography was done, confirming the cholecystitis diagnosis and showing also a wall perforation of one of gallbladders with pericholecystic abscess (Fig. 2). For anatomical analysis of the biliary tree, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed. So, findings confirmed the cholecystitis on gallbladder duplication complicated with a liver abscess. Each gallbladder had an independent cystic duct that joined in a common cystic duct before entering into the common bile duct. Furthermore, only one cystic artery was detected (Fig. 3).
Subsequently, the final diagnosis was a lithiasic cholecystitis on gallbladder duplication complicated with hepatic abscess. To reduce inflammatory sites, the patient was put on antibiotic therapy for a week. An ultrasound control before surgery showed a regression of abscess. Intervention was decided and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was planned.
Intra-operatively, the vesicular compartment was the seat of two gallbladders enveloped in a single peritoneal membrane. The two gallbladders were lithiasic and thick-walled. In front of the impossibility of grasping the gallbladder and the difficulty in identifying the cystic duct, the surgeons decide to convert to an open operation.
The biliary tree dissection showed two cystic ducts that rolled one around the other with biliary leak. So an intraoperative cholangiogram was decided and an opacification of the biliary tree was done after a catheterization of the cystic duct of the first gallbladder (A). This cholangiogram confirmed the presence of a single common cystic duct opening in the common bile duct with retrograde opacification of a separate cystic duct of the second gallbladder (B) (Fig. 4). After ligature of the two separate cystic ducts a cholecystectomy with complete resection of both gallbladders was done without incident (Fig. 5). Exam of the resected specimen revealed one vesicle has a bilious content; the other was filled with a translucent liquid.
The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on post-operative day two. Within four months of follow-up, the patient is yet clinically well.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306521/,5,images/PMC7/PMC730/PMC7306521_01
PMC6172444_01,PMC6172444,Female,67.0,"A 67-year-old woman presented with jaundice and fatigue. She had a 20-mm cyst in the pancreas that had been identified 12 years prior. She underwent CT scan each year since, and the cyst had not changed significantly. A laboratory examination revealed increased levels of bilirubin and hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH, gammaGTP, and ALP). Her serum amylase levels were not elevated. Her CA19-9 levels were slightly elevated, but other tumor markers, such as CEA and AFP, were within normal levels. A CT scan showed another 18-mm solid mass in the pancreatic head that obstructed the common bile duct, and the main pancreatic duct was dilated (Fig. 1). The cyst in the pancreatic body was connected to the pancreatic duct and had grown to 35 mm. Ultrasonography showed that the cyst contained a mural node; intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma was suspected (Fig. 2). The patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; a biopsy of the pancreatic head mass revealed the possibility of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. After biliary drainage, pancreatoduodenectomy was performed, and the cyst within the pancreatic body was resected together with the tumor. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful.
A histopathological examination of the specimen confirmed that the solid mass in the pancreatic head was a well tomoderately differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 30 mm. Vascular invasion and direct infiltration into a lymph node were observed, but lymph node metastasis was not detected. The pathological stage was T3 N1 M0 stage III according to the General Rules for the Study of Pancreatic Cancer (seventh edition) in Japan. In contrast, a 25-mm cystic mass was observed in the pancreatic body (Fig. 3). The wall of the cyst consisted of two components (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The inside of the cyst was lined with glandular structures containing large irregular nuclei and prominent nucleoli in the mucous cells that stained positive for CEA. The other component was represented by outer solid islands consisting of nests of small, uniform cells with round to oval nuclei thatstained negative for CEA and were immunoreactive for synaptophysin and chromogranin A. The Ki-67 index of this region was less than 2%, corresponding to NET G1. The final diagnosis was MANEC. The two malignant tumors were discontinuous and independent of each other.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6172444/,2,images/PMC6/PMC617/PMC6172444_01
PMC3889009_01,PMC3889009,Female,75.0,"A 75-year-old female patient had a history of appendicectomy. Following blunt abdominal injury she was admitted due to lack of bowel movements, abdominal cramps, pain, distension and vomiting. Ileus of the small bowels was established as the underlying cause of her complaints and urgent operation was performed. During abdominal exploration adhesions were found on an approximately, 15 cm section of the terminal ileum and adhesiolysis was carried out. During the operation, Meckel's diverticulum without any sign of inflammation was found and wedge excision was performed. No ectopic tissue could be palpated intraoperatively. Patient passed a smooth post-operative period and the bowel movements returned post-operatively and she was discharged with no complaints.
Pathological work-up of the resected Meckel's diverticulum revealed ectopic tissue in addition to the small bowel, mucosa and gastric glands were found. However, a well-circumscribed lesion of 0.5 cm was also detected that was well-distinguishable from the adjacent tissues. It infiltrated the muscle layer of the bowel, but no further layers were involved. The round, cuboidal cells built up nests and fascicles in the involved area. The nuclei were centrally located the chromatin was finely granulated. Immunohistochemical studies were also performed that proved the suspected diagnosis of carcinoid tumor. They were positive for synaptophysin, but negative for chromogranine, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK20. No vascular or lymphatic invasion was found and no abnormal lymph node could be detected. The final diagnosis was neuroendocrine carcinoma of Meckel's diverticulum based on the pathological finding [Figure 1].

Pregnancy was uncomplicated; all prenatal laboratory tests were unremarkable. The baby was vigorous at birth and required routine delivery room care. On initial examination, the baby was noted to have a rash involving her right chest, arm, and upper back.
 Physical examination showed a symmetrically small for gestation infant. With the exception of the skin examination, the infant had no additional abnormal physical findings. The skin examination was notable for erythematous erosions and scarred, thin plaques, some with overlying crust, in a T1 to T3 dermatomal distribution over the right anterior chest, trunk, and back ( Fig. 1 ). There was a 1.5cm x 0.5cm cicatricial plaque over the right upper back ( Fig. 2 ). Additionally, there were several rounds, erythematous macules and healing round erosions clustered in the same dermatomal distribution along the right upper extremity and dorsum of right hand. There were no intact vesicles present. Nikolsky sign was negative. 
 White blood cell count was 7500 mm 3 with 59% neutrophils, 6% bands, 20% lymphocytes, and 15% monocytes. Hemoglobin was 20.2 g/dL, hematocrit 58.3%, and platelets 66 k/muL. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained 22 red blood cells/mm 3 , 9 white blood cells/mm 3 , protein 90 mg/dL, and glucose 49 mg/dL. Complete metabolic panel was normal. 
A blood culture was drawn and the patient was then started on ampicillin and gentamicin. A skin biopsy, skin bacterial and fungal cultures were obtained. The skin lesions were swabbed for HSV 1/2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Blood samples were sent for rapid plasma regain test, HSV 1/2, VZV, human immunodeficiency virus, and enterovirus PCR. CSF was obtained and sent for HSV 1/2 DNA PCR. While these tests were pending, intravenous (IV) acyclovir was also started. Eye examination and head ultrasound were normal. Maternal serologies were negative for cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma gondii, syphilis, and HSV-1. Mother was rubella and varicella immune. She was negative for anti-Sjogren's-syndrome-related antigen A (SS-A), anti-SS-B, and anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein antibodies. However, her blood sample was positive for HSV-2 immunoglobulin G antibodies.
The patient received 72 hours of antibiotics; all bacterial and fungal cultures returned negative. Thrombocytopenia resolved without intervention. She completed 10 days of IV acyclovir at 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The original skin biopsy showed nonspecific erosion, shallow ulceration, and inflammatory cell infiltrate. Biopsy immunostaining was negative for HSV 1/2. The patient remained in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to work on oral feeding.
 Over the NICU course, the areas of erosion and crusting improved with re-epithelialization and some areas of post-inflammatory hypopigmentation. The cicatricial lesion became smaller in size ( Fig. 3 ). The skin swab from an eroded plaque was positive for HSV-2 DNA by PCR amplification. However, this positive result was suspected to be due to contamination from intrapartum exposure as the swab was obtained in the first few hours of life. The final diagnosis was made 1 week after completion of acyclovir therapy when the patient was noted to have new onset of vesicopustular lesions clustered over the right chest, arm, and palm of right hand ( Fig. 4 ). Repeat biopsy showed classic viral cytopathic changes ( Figs. 5 , 6 ). Lesional immunostaining and PCR confirmed a diagnosis of HSV-2 ( Fig. 7 ). She was diagnosed with intrauterine HSV-2 infection given the presence of the skin lesions at birth. The patient completed a second 14-day course of IV acyclovir and the skin lesions healed. She was then transitioned to oral acyclovir with plan for 6-month course of suppressive therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5828921/,7,images/PMC5/PMC582/PMC5828921_01
PMC10482024_01,PMC10482024,Female,44.0,"This is the case of a 44-year-old female, with a history of four vaginal deliveries, presenting to the hospital with a huge abdominopelvic mass, moderate to severe pelvic pain, and spotting and intermenstrual bleeding for the last one month. She had a history of a failed laparotomy six months back, attempted to remove the mass. There were minor episodes of heavy menstrual problems earlier. As per old operative records, a diagnosis of fibroid uterus had been made. During the attempted surgery, dense adhesions were encountered around the mass and the abdomen had to be closed without proceeding further.
In the present visit, the mass was found to be of 18 weeks size, uniformly enlarged and firm with restricted mobility. There was both a vertical and a transverse scar, resulting from the previous attempted laparotomy.
An endometrial biopsy was planned. On dilating the cervix, around 30 cc of pus was drained out, which had found no mention in the previous sonography done earlier. Escherichia coli was grown and she was treated with antibiotics according to the culture sensitivity report. Endocervical and endometrial biopsy were done to rule out malignancy or tuberculosis.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a normal uterus and endometrium. A mass, possibly a myoma with a well-defined collection was seen possibly arising from the posterior lower uterine segment and cervix. The draining tract was seen to open into the cervix [Figure 1a-c]. Kidneys and ureters were normal. The correct diagnosis was, however, made only after the surgery. A relaparotomy was planned. Due to the previous failed surgery, she insisted on a panhysterectomy.
On laparotomy, an 18 cm x 15 cm x 9 cm mass was seen arising from the pelvis, behind a normal sized uterus. Cornual structures were normal. Dense bowel adhesions were present between the bowel, uterus, and the mass. Adhesiolysis was done followed by pan hysterectomy. The mass was found to be a fibroid arising from the posterior aspect of the cervix [Figure 2].
In the postoperative period, she started developing high-grade fever from the third postoperative day. A small stitch line infection and urinary tract infection were diagnosed and treated, but she remained febrile. Sonography on day 7 was normal. High-grade fever persisted in spite of higher antibiotics. On day 12, she complained of some dirty discharge for which her vault stitches were dilated and around 30 cc blood mixed discharge was drained from the pelvis. Subsequent to the drainage, the fever finally resolved. Culture showed that it was an aseptic collection, possibly because of the prior antibiotics.
On HPE [Figure 3], grossly, the uterus was normal. Cervix measured 5 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm. A large capsulated leiomyoma measuring 18 cm x 15 cm x 9 cm was seen arising from the posterior wall of the cervix. On cutting open through the leiomyoma a cavity/diverticulum of 4cm in diameter was found, which was communication with the endocervical canal. It was filled with pus-like material admixed with blood. On microscopy, the sections were taken from the diverticulum near the lumen of the endocervical canal and the diverticulum wall adjacent to leiomyoma. Sections from both the diverticula showed endocervical glands embedded in fibrocollagenous tissue and mixed inflammatory infiltrate, while subepithelial area showed smooth muscle proliferation.
The final diagnosis was given as cervical fibroid and diverticulum with inflammation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10482024/,5,images/PMC1/PMC104/PMC10482024_01
PMC10165463_01,PMC10165463,Male,37.0,"A 37-year-old man underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy screening, incidentally revealing a gastric submucosal tumor. Two years later, the patient was referred to our institution for diagnosis.
Laboratory findings and tumor markers were within normal levels (cancer embryonic antigen 1.1 ng/ml, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 < 2.0 U/ml). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy findings from the previous physician reported a lesion in the fornix, which was reported to be less than approximately 2 cm (Figure 1a). Our institution showed that the tumor was approximately 2 cm long and had increased in thickness, with a reddish mucosal surface and central depression (Figure 1b). Narrow-band imaging with magnifying endoscopy did not reveal any cancerous characteristics of the mucosa. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a 1.9 cm lesion with poor vascularity in the fourth layer of the gastric wall (Figure 1c). Computed tomography showed no lymph nodes or metastases (Figure 1d). A boring biopsy of the tumor provided a specimen positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) in the proliferating spindle-shaped cells. Therefore, the lesion was diagnosed as a leiomyoma, but surgery was performed for a reliable diagnosis for en bloc resection.
Intra-abdominal observations revealed that the tumor was present on the greater curvature/anterior wall of the fornix and had angiogenesis on the serosa. During partial resection of the stomach using the NEWS method (Figure 2a-d), the tumor margins were identified. The resection line was accurately determined by placing markings both endoscopically and laparoscopically. The tumor was patently inverted into the gastric lumen, followed by an en-bloc resection and transoral retrieval. The operative time was 229 min, including endoscopic observation time. The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 7 without complications, and no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis was observed four years postoperatively.
Macroscopically, the tumor was 2.5 x 2.2 cm in diameter, with a sufficient normal gastric wall tissue margin (Figure 3a). Pathologically, the tumor had an infiltrative growth pattern with spindle-shaped cells growing in a cord-like pattern and round cells with basophilic cytoplasm (Figure 3b,c). Immunohistochemical staining revealed spindle-shaped cells positive for SMA and negative for c-kit, whereas the round cells, positive for CD38 and CD138, were identified as plasma cells. Thus, the final diagnosis was IMT, and the tumor margins were negative. Moreover, ALK expression was negative (Figure 2d).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10165463/,4,images/PMC1/PMC101/PMC10165463_01
PMC10076712_01,PMC10076712,Male,16.0,"A 16-year-old male patient visited the dermatology outpatient department with his father, presenting with progressive yellowish-to-brownish lesions on his face without abnormal sensation for 1 year. The lesions gradually enlarged in size and thickness and were located on both the cheeks and chin. He had no previous medical or mental problems, except for acne, which was self-treated with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel, 1% clindamycin lotion, sulfanilamide with tannin powder (an antibacterial herbal product), and a moisturizer; however, his acne was not considerably improved since he was 14. He also reported no family history of psychiatric illness. The patient could not remove the lesions with soap and wanted to cure this problem because of cosmetic concerns. He reported regular facial washing but was cleansing his face too softly because he felt disturbed by the use of force on his face. His father noticed his obsessively anxious feelings about face touching and concerns about the facial lesions. Accordingly, psychiatric consultation was performed during the first visit.
Dermatological examination revealed multiple well-defined yellowish-to-brownish crusted plaques with a verrucous surface on erythematous-based skin distributed on both cheeks and chin (Figures 1A,B). Our differential diagnosis, in this case, included pemphigus foliaceus, DN, Darier's disease, or seborrheic dermatitis. Based on suspicion of DN, wet compression with normal saline was performed on the lesions for 30 min. The majority of lesions were completely eliminated by rubbing with cotton swabs; however, a few remained. Then, we gently rubbed them with gauze and 70% ethyl alcohol, but the skin eroded and bled. After discussion with the patient, skin biopsy, routine blood tests, and anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 tests were performed for a definitive diagnosis. Histopathological findings revealed orthokeratosis, mild epidermal spongiosis, and perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes in the upper dermis (Figures 2A,B). Immunofluorescence study revealed negative results, and blood tests were within normal limits. Tests for anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 were also negative.
Regarding the psychological evaluation, the patient is an only child from a middle-class family and previously had no known psychological or mental health issues. There was no history of any learning disabilities. At the age of 12, the patient developed acne, which caused distress and diminished his confidence in his appearance. He began spending most of his free time playing computer games alone, neglecting his homework, and growing reluctant to attend school. He stayed up late at night and slept until the afternoon. However, his parents did not realize there was an issue and abandoned him because they also faced financial difficulties during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. During the past year, the patient's facial lesions became more noticeable. His father noticed he appeared frustrated and angry when other family members inquired about his facial lesions. As a result, he separated himself and disregarded his family. The diagnostic assessment using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale revealed his score of 22, indicating moderate obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The patient's compulsion to not touch his face appropriately was driven by his anxious thoughts, which caused him distress and clinically significant impairment in social interaction. Therefore, the diagnosis of OCD and social phobia secondary to his dermatological disorder was performed.
Based on the clinical presentation, investigations, and psychiatric evaluation, the final diagnosis was DN. We advised and encouraged the patient on optimal facial care, using a mild cleanser, and gently rubbed the lesions with cotton swabs and either normal saline or 70% ethyl alcohol. The lesions were completely removed, leaving normal skin and atrophic acne scars. No recurrence was observed after 4 weeks of follow-up, confirming the DN diagnosis (Figures 3A,B). We prescribed oral doxycycline (200 mg/day), 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel, 3% salicylic acid cream, and 1% clindamycin lotion for acne treatment and discussed further acne scar management. He was also treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and fluoxetine (20 mg/day) for his psychiatric disorders. Exposure and Response Prevention techniques were used for his CBT. The psychologist instructed the patient to touch his face with appropriate force, assisted him in overcoming his fear of touching his face, and provided advice on managing his anxious thoughts and effectively implementing the techniques. At 3 months of treatment, considerable improvement in acne and mental problems was noted, and doxycycline and fluoxetine were discontinued.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10076712/,6,images/PMC1/PMC100/PMC10076712_01

In laboratory findings, the leukocyte count was 19,900/ muL, the serum ferritin level was 719.3 ng/mL (10-240), and RF and ANA were negative. During a follow-up, typical skin rash had disappeared after administration of PD, sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine and methotraxate (MTX), but either high fever or polyarthitis was wax and wane, and occasionally, intra-articular injections of corticosteroid were administered. In July 1998, she was admitted to our hospital because of slowly increasing proteinuria over a 7 month period without pitting edema or hypertension. She was single and had no family history of any rheumatic disease or drug history, such as gold or D-penicilliamine.
The results of laboratory data showed that the white-cell count (WBC) was 12,800 / muL, hemoglobin (Hb) was 10.6 g/dL, platelet was 610,000 / muL, ESR was 61 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 9.50 mg/dL (<0.8). The serum protein and albumin had decreased to 4.5 g/dL (6.4-8.5) and 2.1 g/dL (3.2-5.5), respectively. Serum ferritin was within the normal range. Serum autoantibodies and rheumatoid factor were persistently negative. There was no evidence of infection or malignancy. Several urine examinations showed proteinuria without any abnormality in urinary sediments. Twenty-four hour urine protein excretion was 6.9 g/day, and urine creatine clearance was 93.3 mL/min. In radiographic findings, chest PA was normal and bony erosions were detected in both wrist joints. In the sonography, the sizes of both kidneys were 11.5cm on the right and 11cm on the left side with increased renal parenchymal echogenicity.
Renal biopsy showed amorphous deposits in the mesangial areas, some glomerular capillary walls and in the vascular poles (Figure 1). The amyloid deposit stained with Congored displayed apple-green birefringence under the polarizing light. Immunofluorescence study for IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C1, C4, fibrinogen, albumin, and light chains showed segmental positive staining for IgM and C3 in the mesangium and trace (+-) positive staining for light chain. Electron microscopic examination confirmed amyloid deposits in the mesangial areas, which were characterized by non-branching fibrils arranged in a random array (Figure 2A, 2B). Serum protein electrophoresis showed a decrease in both total protein and total albumin without a monoclonal spike. Urine protein electrophoresis showed an elevated total protein level and an elevated total albumin level. Therefore, the final diagnosis was made of secondary renal amyloidosis due to AOSD.
After one intravenous dosage of 500 mg methylprednisolone pulse therapy was administered. We maintained a high oral daily dose of PD (45 mg/day, 1 mg/kg), CTX (100 mg/day), and COL (1.2 mg/day). Two months later, the PD was tapered as proteinuria decreased. After a follow-up 15 months later, laboratory tests showed that the WBC was 6,000 /uL, Hb 13.2 g/dL, platelet 297,000 / muL, ESR 11 mm/hr, CRP 0.11 mg/dL, and the serum protein and albumin had increased to 6.2 g/dL and 4.2 g/dL, respectively. The serum ferritin was 24.3 ng/mL. The urine protein clearance was decreased from 6.9 g/day to 92 mg/day.

PMC8645467_01,PMC8645467,Male,52.0,"A 52-year-old male presented with 2 weeks of a progressive quadriparesis (i.e. loss of dexterity in both hands and lower extremity weakness) and urinary incontinence. He also had cervical lymphadenopathy (i.e. anterior/posterior and post-auricular lymph nodes). On exam, he had 4/5 weakness in both lower extremities, diffuse lower extremity hyper-reflexia with bilateral Babinski responses, and a T2 sensory level (mJOA-10/18).
The X-rays and CT scan revealed a destructive lytic C2-C4 lesion focused at the C3 level vertebral body (i.e. destructive lytic lesion of anterior/posterior C3, the C2 spinous process, and anterior C4 vertebral body) [Figure 1]. MRI showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the neck along with lytic lesions involving C3 (i.e. both anterior and posterior elements). Furthermore, an epidural soft-tissue mass causing spinal cord compression was seen posteriorly at the C3-4 level. Although predominantly dorsal, the lesion wrapped circumferentially around the spinal cord bilaterally. The lesion was isointense to hypointense as compared with the spinal cord on T2 weighted images and hyperintense to cord on the T2-weighted image [Figure 2] The PET CT confirmed increase uptake at C3 alone [Figure 3]. The predominant differential diagnoses included lymphoma or metastatic tumors or infection.
In view of a Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score of 14, the evidence of spinal cord compression and likely instability, the patient underwent a C3-4/laminectomy with C2-4/5 posterior fusion. At surgery, the posterior cervical paraspinal musculature infiltrated by tumor and had to be removed. A novel ""three rod construct"" fusion was performed that included C2 pedicle screws, laminar screws, a C4 left pedicle screw with lateral mass fixation of C4 and C5 [Figure 4]. The frozen section diagnosis was lymphoma. Postoperatively, the patient had complete neurological recovery except for bladder dysfunction.
Histopathology was consistent with a lymphoproliferative disorder (i.e. with follicles of different size with abnormal germinal structures at their centres with hyaline-vascular or ""burnt-out"" appearances) [Figure 5]. The Mantle zone was expanded with concentric layering and an ""onion skin"" appearance. Immunohistochemical stains revealed a normal distribution of B and T cells and intact germinal centres with a normal distribution of dendritic reticulum cells. The final diagnosis was CD of hyaline-vascular type.
The patient was started on methylprednisolone for the lymphadenopathy, and diagnosis of CD. This was followed by radiotherapy (total dose 3960cGy in 22 fractions).
At the last follow-up 1 year later, patient remained asymptomatic without evidence of lesion progression [Figure 6].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8645467/,9,images/PMC8/PMC864/PMC8645467_01
PMC5140862_02,PMC5140862,Female,,"A woman in her 60s had discomfort in her back. She had been pointed out to have a cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas by a medical examination from three years prior to this presentation. It was diagnosed to be an IPMN of the side branch which measured about 30 mm in diameter. On our examination by abdominal US the lesion had increased to a diameter of 35 mm. Her medical history included appendectomy at 15 years of age. Laboratory data showed the serum CA19-9 level to be slightly elevated at 52.9 U/mL. Abdominal US showed the multilocular cystic lesion to measure 35 mm in size and be located within the pancreatic tail. The borders were clearly demarcated and the lesion showed internal heterogeneity. Contrast enhanced abdominal CT revealed a multilocular cystic lesion, measuring 35 mm in size, within the pancreatic tail. The solid component in the dorsal portion was revealed and showed enhancement similar to the spleen (artery phase) (Fig. 4A), (portal phase) (Fig. 4B). An abdominal MRI showed a multilocular cystic lesion having a low T1 signal and a high T2 signal. EUS showed a 35 mm multilocular cystic lesion within the pancreatic tail with an internal nodule (Fig. 5). ERCP views showed no papillary orifice dilatation or mucus. The cystic lesion was not in continuity between the pancreatic duct and the cyst. A cytologic examination of pancreatic juice showed no malignant cells. Given that cystic neoplasms including IPMN were included in the differential diagnosis, we proceeded with resection by a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. The gross appearance showed a multi cystic lesion measuring 35 mm in size with a hyalinized fibrous capsule. The serosity was accumulated in the lumen (Fig. 6A). The histopathological views were similar to case 1 (Fig. 6B and C) and the final diagnosis was an epidermoid cyst of an intrapancreatic accessory spleen. The progress was good, and she left the hospital on the 14th day after the operation. The tumor markers normalized after the operation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5140862/,6,images/PMC5/PMC514/PMC5140862_02
PMC8784412_01,PMC8784412,Female,48.0,"A 48-year-old woman with a gynecological-obstetric history of 2 pregnancies, obtained by cesarean section. Her condition began 6 months before admission, with intermittent metrorrhagia, dyspepsia, pain; increased abdominal volume and metrorragia were added. A Colposcopy and biopsy was performed, which reported a high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma vs. carcinosarcoma. Subsequent symptoms were presented; abundant transvaginal bleeding and evidence of hypovolemic shock, requiring a transfusion of 3 blood packs and a hemostatic radiotherapy dose of 6 Gy. A revision of previous pathological material was requested to establish therapeutic conduct.
The slide review revealed a mixed malignant neoplasm consisting mostly of spindle-shaped and ovoid stromal cells arranged in a tapered pattern, with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclei with dense chromatin, evident nucleoli, and atypical mitoses; They coexisted with glands with an endometrial, tubular, and semitortuous appearance, lined by columnar epithelium with a proliferative appearance, with pseudostratified, discrete atypia, almost absent, without mitosis and luminal secretion. Around these glands, we observed packing of the spindle cells, arranged in a string of pearls pattern, and toward the periphery, there were paucicellular areas. The formation of ""leaf-shaped"" structures was also identified, with a low columnar epithelial lining, without atypia, and below it, the elongated cells described above. Extensive areas of highly cellular cartilage were identified, with moderate pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, and evident nucleoli. No areas of necrosis were identified. It was reported as UASO with heterologous elements of grade 2 chondrosarcoma (Figure 1).
A computed tomography scan was performed that showed a neoformative process at the cervical level (Figures 2A,B). An abdominal ultrasound reported a uterine morphological alteration, at the level of the isthmus with an oval nodule with poorly defined margins, with internal vascularity, the endometrium with homogeneous echogenicity, and without alterations in the ovaries. With these findings, she was scheduled for a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy.
We received in our pathological anatomy department a surgical specimen that included cervical, endocervical, and lower uterine segment deformity, identifying an irregular tumor located toward the left inferolateral portion. We observed a heterogeneous tumor originating in the lower uterine segment, 9 cm in diameter, friable, grayish-brown, with hemorrhagic areas and areas of cartilaginous appearance, protruding through the endocervical canal, with expansion to the exocervix, without ulceration of the epithelium. No involvement of the endometrium and myometrium of the fundus and uterine walls were identified; however, there is 100% invasion of the left muscular wall of the lower uterine segment (Myometrium of the lower uterine segment thickness: 1.7 cm. Tumor size: 9 cm) (Figure 3). The rest of the organs sent did not present macroscopic alterations. The histological sections showed what was previously observed, direct involvement of the left parametrium of endometrial stromal sarcoma and chondrosarcoma component, without vascular invasion. Surgical margins were negative. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD10, estrogen and progesterone receptors, p53, cyclin D1, WT1, PMS2, b-catenin an S100, it last found chondrosarcoma component (Figure 4). The final diagnosis was UASO with heterologous elements of grade 2 chondrosarcoma, with extension toward the endocervix and protrusion of the endocervical canal (pT1C, FIGO IB).
The patient was discharged and was kept under active surveillance by the oncology service, and without receiving adjuvant therapy. However, three months after the surgery, the patient presented intermittent abdominal pain. Abdominopelvic computed tomography was performed identifying a tumor adhered to the pelvic and abdominal cavity with dimensions of 30 x 25 cm (Figure 1C), with multiples peritoneal implants, for which she was operated on again. The patient underwent optimal debulking plus packaging, presented bleeding of 5,000 ml, 4 globular units and expander fluids were administered. We received in the Pathology department, a multifragmented tumor with a soft necrohemorrhagic appearance, and in the histological study with the characteristics already mentioned above. During her hospitalization, she developed pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism computed tomography was performed, where a thrombus was evidenced in the right pulmonary artery, which led to a pulmonary infarction of the right lower lobe. Acenocoumarin was administered, despite this, she developed right lower extremity thrombosis. It was assessed by the Departments of Clinical Oncology and Radiotherapy, concluding that it was out of clinical treatment based on the added underlying pathologies. He is currently in palliative treatment, with acenocoumarin and morphine for pain management.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8784412/,3,images/PMC8/PMC878/PMC8784412_01
PMC3909864_01,PMC3909864,Female,57.0,"A 57-year-old female presented with a several-year history of unexplained dyspeptic symptoms. Numerous vague causes were suggested including oesophagitis due to a small hiatal hernia and treated with lansoprazole and dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi on the basis of a hepato-biliary scintigraphy (data not shown).
During the past year, the patient had experienced three acute episodes characterized by hypogastric colic pain followed colickly pain followed by alimentary-but occasionaly fecaloid-vomiting. These episodes lasted for about 24 to 48 hours and ended by diarrheal debacle. During the last episode, the patient was admitted to the emergency room after the ending diarrheal debacle. Laboratory tests and abdominal plain film were normal at this time. A new episode of abdominal pain compelled the patient to get readmitted to the emergency room. The pain was increasing for a period of 24 hours. The patient remained apyretic. On physical examination, the abdomen was distended. On palpation, there was diffuse tenderness especially in the right iliac fossa. Auscultation revealed a metallic sound. Laboratory test results indicated a mild inflammation with a CRP level of 5.84 mg/L (normal value: < 5 mg/L) and a white blood cell count of 16200 units.
Contrast-enhanced abdominal multidetector-row computed tomography (Fig. 1A-D) revealed a subocclusive intestinal syndrome. The middle and distal small bowel loops were distended along with the presence of hydroaeric levels. The transitional level was found within the pelvic area, and the origin seemed to be related to diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis including pelvic masses and nodules diffusely covering and encasing the gynecological structures, the terminal ileum and the pelvic folds. A small amount of ascites was present. Numerous smaller nodules were scattered in the hypogastrium and in both iliac fossae. Some nodules were partially calcified and moderately enhanced on delayed contrast-enhanced CT scan. A possible ovarian origin was considered. The option of an emergency surgery was chosen to treat the subocclusive intestinal syndrome. An extensive surgical procedure was performed at one time including total radical hysterectomy, debulking, omentectomy, and resection of the ileo-cecal junction with resection of more than 30 centimeters of the terminal ileum.
Gross anatomy (Fig. 1E, F) showed numerous whitish nodules which extensively covered and invaded the gynecologic structures, the wall of the ileum and the mesenteric fat tissue. The pattern of invasion was that of diffuse carcinomatosis. On sections, some of these nodules were found to deeply penetrate the entire bowel wall from the serosa to the mucosa (Fig. 1G).
Microscopically (Fig. 1 H-K), these nodules showed areas of dense storiform fibrosis separated by areas of dense lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate containing numerous normal plasma cells. Typical mild to moderate eosinophilia, germinal center formation and obliterative phlebitis were also detected. IgG4 immunostaining showed numerous IgG4-positive plasma cells.
The final diagnosis was IgG4-RD with a predominant but a very unusual peritoneal involvement. The serum IgG4 level was not assessed in the preoperative period, but it was found to be normal in the postoperative and follow-up periods.
The patient was treated by methylprednisolone with an initial dose of 32 mg per day. This dose was reduced in a stepwise manner to 12 mg per day. Due to persistent small peritoneal nodules in the right iliac fossa and in the pouch of Douglas after six months (data not shown), azathioprine at a dose of 100 mg daily was added. Concomitantly, the dose of methylprednisolone was gradually lowered to 2 mg per day. At one year of evolution, the remaining small nodules were stable (data not shown).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3909864/,11,images/PMC3/PMC390/PMC3909864_01
PMC5106525_01,PMC5106525,Female,19.0,"A 19-year-old, gravida 0, para 0, female presented to the emergency room with worsening right sided abdominal pain. She had been previously healthy but with a history of menstrual irregularities and heavy bleeding since age 14. On physical exam, she had noticeable hirsutism, including male-pattern pubic hair growth, and an obvious lower abdominal mass. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, and a pelvic ultrasound were performed.
CT scan with oral and intravenous contrast was initially performed and showed a large, multi-lobulated, predominantly low-attenuation mass with numerous septations of varying thickness in the abdomen and pelvis measuring approximately 27 x 22 x 15 cm (Figure 1, Figure 2). There was no calcification appreciated. A moderate amount of ascites and numerous non-enlarged peri-aortic lymph nodes were appreciated. The ovaries were not identified on the CT scan, thus a pelvic ultrasound was performed. This re-demonstrated the large pelvic mass, which appeared complex with both cystic and solid components (Fig. 3). Most walls appeared thick and irregular. Free intra-abdominal and pelvic ascites was again noted. The right ovary was not identified, suggesting ovarian origin for this mass. The left ovary and uterus appeared normal.
An exploratory laparotomy found a 27 x 21 x 15 cm right ovarian cystic and solid mass (Fig. 4). Some cysts appear to have ruptured. There is a moderate amount of intraabdominal ascites. Frozen section suggested ovarian malignancy, thus a staging procedure was done. Pelvic and periaortic lymph nodes, as well as omentum and ascites were negative for malignancy. Right salpingo-oopherectomy was performed.
The smooth pink-tan mass was 27 cm in greatest dimention and weighed 3482 grams. It was 60% solid and 40% cystic. The cystic portions had ragged, hemorrhagic internal surfaces (Fig. 5). The solid areas contained cells with round nuclei with granular nuclear chromatin, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with indistinct borders, and areas of extensive necrosis (Fig. 6A). Frequent mitoses, some nuclear anaplasia were evident. In some areas, cells contain more glassy cytoplasm with some multinucleation. Some cystic spaces contain small amount of gray proteinaceous material. Abundant lutenization of irregular ovarian follicles had occurred. Branching fibrous fronds are present throughout the lesion (Fig. 6B). No Call-Exner bodies were identified. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for inhibin and focally positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.
The final diagnosis was juvenile granulosa cell tumor, FIGO Stage IC. The stage is based on the intraoperative findings of tumor on the ovarian surface, but limited to ovary (i.e. no pelvic extension), and no macroscopic peritoneal or regional lymph node metastases. Pathologic findings of lack of microscopic nodal or omental metastasis and negative ascites further clarified the stage. No distant metastases were present.
Given the initial stage of disease assigned to the patient, no further treatment was implemented and a 3 month follow-up CT was done for surveillance. This CT revealed two new low density liver lesions, 3.4 and 4 cm in size, and new soft tissue masses in the splenic hilum, all consistent with metastases. Despite numerous cycles of varying chemotherapy regimens, the most recent CT scan demonstrated enlargement and increased number of both liver lesions and peritoneal implants in the splenic hilum. Additionally, new small loculated fluid collections are now clearly present in the right adnexa suggesting recurrent pelvic disease (Fig. 7). Her serum inhibin level remains elevated.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5106525/,6,images/PMC5/PMC510/PMC5106525_01
PMC4310058_01,PMC4310058,Male,16.0,"A 16-year-old male presented for evaluation of an indentation of his right parietal skull. The patient had first noted the indentation 2 weeks prior with no recent change in size. He had been involved in a 4-wheeler accident 2 years before and was evaluated for a possible concussion during a football game about one and a half years prior to presentation. The patient described having occasional headaches, but had no local tenderness or other neurological symptoms.
On examination, the patient was noted to have a palpable defect and indentation of the right parietal bone. The overlying scalp was unremarkable and he was neurologically intact.
The patient's previous imaging was reviewed. The first study, from 2 years prior, showed a skull defect in the right parietal bone [Figure 1a]. The second and third computed tomography (CT) scans showed progressive erosion of the skull [Figure 1b and c]. The defect did not appear to involve the dura or scalp. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained and confirmed the localization of the lesion to the skull [Figure 1e-f].
Excision of the skull defect and right parietal cranioplasty with titanium plate was performed. The overlying tissue was grossly abnormal, measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter, and was removed en bloc. The underlying bone was thin and eggshell like with a trabeculated pattern, especially in the center. Peripherally, the bone was thickened with a sponge-like appearance. The abnormal tissue portion could be seen replacing the diploic space while leaving the inner and outer table intact at the periphery. The dura was not involved and was stripped from the bone and left intact. The abnormal bone was then removed and a mesh titanium plate was used to replace the cranial defect [Figures 1d and 3].
The patient tolerated the operation well and had no immediate operative or perioperative complications. The right parietal indentation was corrected and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 2.
On gross examination, the soft tissue lesion appeared rubbery, yellow, and avascular. The tissue consisted predominantly of dense fibrous tissue with a few foci of woven bone at the periphery adjacent to the eroded bone. Angulated spicules of bone were rare, some of which lacked osteoblastic rimming while others were rimmed. There was minimal inflammation. The final diagnosis was that of a benign fibro-osseous lesion most in keeping with a DF. The case was reviewed at the Mayo Clinic where it was felt to be an atypical FD. Conflicting pathology interpretations of these lesions is not uncommon.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310058/,2,images/PMC4/PMC431/PMC4310058_01
PMC7265469_01,PMC7265469,Female,42.0,"A 42-year-old woman presented to our department with slight visual deterioration [Figure 1a]. Intracranial computed tomography (CT) showed a high-attenuated mass, including granular-like dots in the sellar and suprasellar regions, accompanied by an expansion of the sella turcica [Figure 1b and c]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed well-circumscribed, globular masses. The solid part was isointense, but the inside part of the mass was low intensity on T1-weighted imaging (WI) and T2-WI, and homogeneously enhanced to a moderate degree with gadolinium (Gd). The tumor extended into the suprasellar region, compressing the optic chiasm. The Gd-enhanced anterior pituitary gland was displaced supra-anteriorly, and high intensity on T1-WI suggested that the posterior pituitary appeared [Figure 2a-c]. Measurements of levels of hormones related to the anterior pituitary showed mild hyperprolactinemia (prolactin: 34.6 ng/ml; normal, <32.7 ng/ml). In terms of posterior pituitary function, there was not recognized diabetes insipidus. Preoperative differential diagnoses included pituitary adenoma, germ-cell tumor, sellar meningioma, pituicytoma, and glioma arising from the posterior pituitary. To confirm the histological diagnosis, ETSS was performed. Intraoperative findings demonstrated that this tumor was solid and extremely firm, including myriad yellowish granules without bleeding [Figure 3a and b]. The tumor originated from the posterior pituitary gland and had a clear margin between it and the anterior pituitary gland [Figure 3c]. Subtotal resection was achieved to reduce compression of the optic nerve [Figure 3d]. Pathological examination with hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrated round or polygonal cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. Most nuclei were round to oval, with no evidence of cellular atypia or mitotic figures. In addition, perivascular lymphocytic aggregates were recognized [Figure 4a and b]. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of cytoplasmic granules was resistant to diastase digestion [Figure 4c and d]. Immunohistochemical studies were performed with antibodies for S-100, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Ki-67, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). Tumor cells were immunoreactive for S-100 protein, but negative for GFAP [Figure 5a and b]. The Ki-67 (MIB-1) proliferation-related labeling index was low, at 2.0% [Figure 5c]. In addition, almost all tumor cells appeared strongly positive for TTF-1 [Figure 5d]. Taking all these results into account, the final diagnosis was GCT of the sellar region, belonging to tumors of the posterior pituitary in accordance with the WHO classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (2016). The patient remained clinically stable with a normal visual field, the residual tumor showed no enlargement at the next 1-year follow-up visit [Figure 3b], and the hormonal dysfunction (hyperprolactinemia) improved to near-normal levels (prolactin: 15.5 ng/ml).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7265469/,4,images/PMC7/PMC726/PMC7265469_01
PMC3290871_01,PMC3290871,Female,2.0,"A 2-year-old girl was brought to the Kintampo Municipal (District) Hospital in rural Ghana because the child's mother noticed a mass in the abdomen. The mother related that she had noticed it for some time, but wasn't sure for how long. She stated that the child had no changes in her eating or defecation pattern, no bleeding or bruising, fever, night sweats, behavioral changes or any other pertinent medical history.
On physical exam, the 10 Kg child had a normal physical exam other than a 10 x 5 cm mass overlying the right colon (Figure 1). It appeared to be mobile and non-tender. There was no evidence of an underlying infectious process, bowel obstruction, organomegaly, mechanical difficulties with breathing, lymphadenopathy, or compromised venous return from the mass. The mass caused no venous return or intestinal motility. The liver could be felt as a discrete organ.
Her urinalysis was normal and a complete blood count demonstrated a Hgb 10.1 g/dL, WBC 7.2 x 109/L, and a normal differential. An ultrasound demonstrated a non-specific, probably cystic mass in the abdomen without any other identifiable pathology. An upright radiograph showed displaced bowel. No other laboratory tests or imaging modalities were available at this hospital.
Clinicians suggested that the child be taken to another facility, but the mother's finances, family situation, and reluctance to go elsewhere precluded that option. When it became clear that the mother would not take the child to the closest hospital with better diagnostic and treatment facilities, the decision was made to operate. The general physician, who also does surgery, performed the procedure.
Given the prevalence of parasitosis in the population and the child's rather benign presentation, the preoperative diagnosis was a probable parasitic cyst. The child was brought to the theater where, under general anesthesia, a midline laparotomy was performed. A large, smooth, glistening mass was immediately apparent occupying the right side and around 1/3 of the total abdomen. It was isolated from the iliac mesentery and removed intact (Figure 2). It weighed 1Kg. The child had an uneventful recovery. The specimen was sent to a pathologist at another hospital.
The pathology report showed a ""huge cystic mass measuring about 10 cm in diameter and roughly spherical in shape containing serous fluid. Cut section reveals copious serous fluid."" The final diagnosis was a mesenteric dermoid cyst without evidence of malignancy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3290871/,2,images/PMC3/PMC329/PMC3290871_01
PMC9114644_01,PMC9114644,Female,28.0,"A 28-year-old woman was admitted to the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Hunan, China because of recurrent cough for 6 years and wheezing for 7 months, which aggravated for half a month in May 2021. The patient started to cough sputum early in September 2014, and pulmonary tuberculosis was considered the reason at the local hospital and therefore anti-tuberculosis was given. The symptoms improved significantly until 2015; the patient complained of cough with fever during the anti-tuberculosis therapy and visited our hospital for the first time. Laboratory tests showed an elevated level of leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and serum total IgE (2,500 IU/ml, normal range: <130 IU/ml). The chest CT revealed multiple cavitary lesions in both upper lungs and the dorsal segment of the left lower lung and bronchiectasis of bilateral lobes (Figure 1A). A combined infection of aspergillosis and Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed by positive culture of both sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Anti-infection with teicoplanin and itraconazole was prescribed, and her symptoms were relieved on therapy. The patient remained stable until 2019; she began coughing intermittently and the symptoms gradually worsened when accompanied with dyspnea and wheezing. She visited our hospital for the second time in December 2020. Blood tests showed a moderately elevated level of eosinophil count (0.97 x 109/L, normal range: 0.02-0.52 x 109/L) and a markedly increased serum total IgE level (>2,500 IU/ml). Total levels of aspergillosis-specific IgE, IgM, and IgG were above normal. A pulmonary function test revealed decreased FVC (2.41 L; expected value: 2.92 L), decreased FEV1 (1.54 L, expected value: 2.53 L), and decreased FEV1/FVC (63.68%, expected value: 84.52%), indicating moderate obstructive pulmonary ventilation dysfunction and positive bronchodilation test (FEV1 increased by 16.8%). The chest CT revealed bilateral multiple bronchiectases, pulmonary bulla, and atelectasis in the right middle lung lobe (Figure 1B). Based on these data, a diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) was made. Oral voriconazole 200 mg two times daily and methylprednisolone 16 mg per day plus inhaler were prescribed but were demonstrated to be insufficient without the improvement of symptoms. Since February 2021, she was given omalizumab 600 mg three times every month; she was readmitted due to the aggravation of cough and wheezing. The patient denied any history of food or drug allergies. Her family history was negative for any inherited genetic diseases.
On physical examination, her body weight was 58 kg on admission. She exhibited facial flushing, a full moony face, buffalo back, and mossy skin changes on the scalp. Moist rales could be heard on bilateral lung fields. Her laboratory findings on admission revealed moderate C-reactive protein level (33.6 mg/l, reference range: 0-6 mg/l) and a normal level of leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation. Serum IgE was above normal (770 IU/ml, reference range: <130 IU/ml); serum -beta-D-glucan test, galactomannan test, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, vasculitis antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens, and rheumatoid factor were negative. Pulmonary CT suggested diffuse multiple ground glass shadows and scattered striae in both lungs and more cystic lesions than previously observed (Figure 1C). Bronchoscopy showed viscous jelly-like secretions in the tracheal lumen. The next-generation sequence (NGS) of BALF indicated Pneumocystis jirovecii (sequence reads 34909), Human Herpes Virus Type 5 (also named CMV, sequence reads 1843), and Human Herpes Virus Type 4 (also named EBV, sequence reads 7). With classic diffuse ground-glass lesions appearing in the chest CT images and high sequence reads of CMV and P. jirovecii in BALF detected by mNGS, we identified that the patient had CMV and P. jirovecii coinfection. The sequence reads of EBV, which is ubiquitous in most of the population, were too few to be identified as pathogenic. SMZ-TMP and ganciclovir were given and symptoms were gradually relieved (Figure 2).
Given that the young patient was predisposed to multiple pathogens, including some opportunistic strains, we carefully reviewed the patient's medical history. Surprisingly, she had multiple skin rashes and pruritus all over the body since childhood. A minor traumatic fracture of the right calf occurred at the age of 12. She underwent cutaneous abscesses requiring incision and drainage at 13 years of age. The patient also had a previous diagnosis of pelvic abscess, tubal occlusion, and primary infertility. The patient had recurrent infections of different strains including opportunistic pathogens in multiple organs, skin rashes, and markedly elevated IgE levels. HIES were suspected, and she scored 45 points on the National Institutes of Health clinical HIES scoring system. Further whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to screen potential mutations, indicating a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 15 of STAT3 (c.1294G>T, g.62382G>T, p.Val432Leu, NM_139276.2). Consequently, the final diagnosis was made as AD-HIES. Her parents and younger sister are wild-type genotypes. In addition to the standard anti-infection therapy, we prescribed omalizumab 300 mg every 2 weeks and Seretide inhalation. Oral corticosteroids gradually reduced and stopped. During 6 months of follow-up, the patient did not experience recurrent infection. After an initial fluctuation of the level, serum IgE remained stable recently. The patient's symptoms and lung function improved on therapy (Figure 3). The chest CT scan demonstrated improved infiltrates (Figure 1D).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9114644/,7,images/PMC9/PMC911/PMC9114644_01

Earlier in the same year, a routine health check-up had shown that her hemoglobin was 13.0 g/dL. Seven months before the detection of anemia, she developed fatigue and loss of appetite; she also noticed alopecia in April. In June, bilateral leg edema developed and she occasionally had fever (body temperature, 38C). She consulted a doctor. Neither gastrointestinal fiberscopy nor a gynecological examination revealed a cause of her anemia. Before referral to our hospital, scleritis was identified by an ophthalmologist.
On admission, a physical examination revealed pedal edema, but there was no malar rash, discoid rash, oral ulceration, or arthritis. The admission laboratory data are shown in Table. The antinuclear antibody titer was 1 in 5,120 and the anti-dsDNA antibody titer was 4,200 IU/mL (normal <12 IU/mL). She also had proteinuria in the nephrotic range (3.73 g/day) with no M-protein. SLE was diagnosed according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria.
A renal biopsy was performed to evaluate the patient's nephrotic syndrome. Light microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen containing 68 glomeruli revealed global sclerosis in only 1 glomerulus. Endocapillary glomerulonephritis, with karyorrhexis, fibrinoid necrosis, and rupture of the glomerular basement membrane, cellular crescents, and hyaline thrombus were observed (Fig. 1a). However, there was no definite spike formation in the capillary walls (Fig. 1b). Because <50% of all of the glomeruli were affected, class III (A) lupus nephritis was diagnosed according to the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classification. An immunohistochemical examination revealed faint staining for IgG and C3 deposition in the mesangial and subendothelial regions (Fig. 1c). Electron microscopy showed very small mesangial and subendothelial deposits, but there was diffuse and advanced effacement of the foot processes of podocytes (>70%) (Fig. 1d).
Computed tomography was performed to investigate systemic complications and an anterior mediastinal mass (29x15x26 mm), that showed marked enhancement by contrast medium (Fig. 2a). As the patient had no symptoms related to myasthenia gravis, such as muscle weakness or dysphagia, and the above-mentioned renal biopsy indicated lupus nephritis with the need for long-term immunosuppression, we decided to prioritize the surgical resection of the mediastinal tumor, the diagnosis of which was undetermined. The mass was resected by video-assisted thoracoscopy. Macroscopic inspection of the resected mass revealed a yellowish-white tumor (29x15x26 mm) with a fibrous capsule that featured the proliferation of spindle-like cells in bundles mixed with lymphoid cells (Fig. 2b). The final diagnosis was noninvasive thymoma [type A (according to the WHO classification) and Masaoka stage 1].
One week after the resection of the thymoma, the patient's high-grade fever persisted; however, her proteinuria was reduced (3.81 g/g creatinine to 1.20 g/g creatinine). Thus, treatment was initiated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (1,000 mg/day for 3 days), followed by oral prednisolone (30 mg/day). Her fever subsided rapidly and her urinary protein excretion also improved to 0.42 g/day after 1 week, while her leukopenia and hypocomplementemia resolved after 2 weeks (Fig. 3), after which she was discharged.
After the patient's discharge, the prednisolone dose was tapered; tacrolimus (2 mg, daily) was added when the prednisolone dosage was reduced to 20 mg daily. Although the recrudescence of arthralgia and the increase in the ds-DNA level was seen when tacrolimus was switched to mycophenolate mofetil (1,000 mg daily; at the time, the prednisolone dosage was 12.5 mg), immediate control was achieved after restarting tacrolimus at the same dosage. At present, the patient remains well under daily treatment with prednisolone (5 mg), mycophenolate mofetil (1,500 mg), and tacrolimus (2 mg).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5790719/,3,images/PMC5/PMC579/PMC5790719_01
PMC5724926_01,PMC5724926,Female,68.0,"A 68-year-old woman presented with symptoms of appetite loss, weight loss, and abdominal pain that had persisted for 4 months. During a general health examination at a local clinic, para-aortic LAP was detected by abdominal tomography. Tru-Cut biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma with probable primary ovarian or other serosal origin. She was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and management. There was no significant physical findings. Except for anemia (level of hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dl), hematological and biochemical parameters were normal. The level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in her serum was elevated to 50 ng/mL (normal: 0-32 ng/mL), whereas levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (normal: 0-3 ng/mL), and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) (normal: 0-10 mlU/ml) in the serum were within the normal limits. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed gastric wall thickness at the lesser curvature of the mid body in addition to para-aortic lymph node enlargement. Upper digestive tract endoscopy showed a 5-6 cm-ulcerofungating mass in the lesser curvature of the gastric body. Histopathologic findings following gastroduodenoscopy revealed an invasive poorly differantiated adenocarcinoma. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and esophagojejunostomy were performed. Precise histopathological examination of resected specimens revealed the presence of a moderate-to-poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma, with features of YST. An elevated tumor, 6x5x3 cm in size, with surface ulceration and hemorrhage was located in the antral minor curvature of the stomach. The tumor was primarily located in the mucosa and submucosa. The final diagnosis was T3, N3, M0, and stage III according to the Japanese classification of gastric cancer. Metastases to perigastric lymph nodes were also observed. The gastric tumor was composed of two histological types: YST and a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. Majority of the tumor was occupied by a YST which showed the most common reticular pattern (Fig. 1A, Fig. 1B). Schiller-Duval bodies were also sporadically observed. Other components of germ cell tumors, like embryonal carcinomas and choriocarcinomas, were not identified. In the yolk sac component, tumor cells showed immunoreactivity for cytokeratin (Fig. 1C) and AFP (Fig. 1D) but not for CEA, chromogranin A, cytokeratins 7 and 20, beta-HCG, CDX2, placental alkaline phosphatase, and CD30. Focal staining for AFP was also observed in the adenocarcinoma foci (Fig. 2). Alternatively, CEA was strongly positive in the adenocarcinoma. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the 9 th postoperative day with a plan for chemotherapy. The patient died in 8 months after the surgery.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5724926/,6,images/PMC5/PMC572/PMC5724926_01

PMC3364047_01,PMC3364047,Female,50.0,"A 50-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma (MM) in complete remission after high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue was admitted with swelling and overtearing of the left eye. With the prediagnosis of NLD obstruction, dacryoscintigraphy was planned. In two weeks, erythema and swelling around the left eye and nose became evident. Antimicrobial therapy for one week was given with suspicion of dacryocystitis. Yet, the symptoms progressed with additional symptoms of diplopia and bloody discharge from left nose (fig. 1). MRI of the orbit and paranasal sinuses revealed a 3 x 5 x 7.5 cm mass in the left sinonasal area infiltrating the left anterior, medial, posterior ethmoidal sinuses, left nasal cavity, left maxillary sinus, left orbit, left soft and hard palates and displacing the left globe laterally. The mass also extended to the NLD, the left pterygomaxillary fossa, infratemporal fossa and middle cranial fossa (fig. 2). Excisional biopsy of the paranasal sinus revealed diffuse CD38-positive plasma cell infiltration with kappa light chain restriction (fig. 3). On serum protein electrophoresis, a monoclonal protein of 0.01 g/dl was present and immunofixation electrophoresis in serum and urine showed the same amount of paraproteinemia as at the time of initial diagnosis as MM. Serum kappa light chain levels were increased (882 mg/l). Serum albumin and beta 2-microglobulin levels were normal; serum LDH level was slightly increased. The final diagnosis was extramedullary relapse of MM. High-dose steroid was given as urgent treatment followed by debulking surgery including left maxillectomy, resection of the inferior orbital wall and a portion of the soft and hard palates. Histopathologic examination of the surgical material showed diffuse plasma cell infiltration (fig. 4). On postoperative orbital MRI, a 2.5 x 2 cm residual mass in the left medial pterygoid muscle was present. One month after the surgery, allergic reaction developed against the prosthetic support material placed under the orbit resulting in orbital displacement. Hence, the remission induction chemotherapy was postponed. The prosthesis was removed. Biopsy sample from the orbital soft tissue showed granulation tissue, fibrosis and foreign body reaction. Radiotherapy was also postponed in anticipation for delay in wound healing. Two months later, orbital reconstruction was made by forehead flap. At that time, serum kappa light chain decreased to 109 mg/l. Salvage chemotherapy with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone for three courses was given. Three months later, radiotherapy at 36 Gy in 18 fractions was performed to the postoperative residual tissue at the left mastoid region.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3364047/,8,images/PMC3/PMC336/PMC3364047_01
PMC4634163_01,PMC4634163,Male,11.0,"An 11-year-old boy presented with a history of a sudden loss of consciousness followed by vomiting, the day before. His past medical history revealed right-sided hemiplegia and UMN facial palsy one year earlier. On examination, the patient was conscious, oriented to time, place and person. He had hemiplegic gait, increased muscle tone and decreased power on the right side.
During last hospitalization, an MRI study was performed to define the extent of his neurological lesions. An acute infarct was noted on T2, FLAIR and DW images in the left gangliocapsular region (Figure 1A, 1B). MR Angiogram showed complete cut-off of segment M1 of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and an aneurysm in the intradural segment of the right vertebral artery (Figure 2). After one month, follow-up MRI with MRA showed gliotic area in the left gangliocapsular region and a partially recanalized, tortuous, narrowed left MCA (Figure 3A, 3B).
On digital subtraction angiography (DSA), left MCA appeared irregular, narrowed, and tortuous, and multiple aneurysms were seen in distal branches of bilateral MCA (right>left) (Figures 4, 5) and in the intradural segment of the right vertebral artery (Figure 6A, 6B). The lesions had focal fusiform morphology suggestive of myxomatous aneurysms. Further on the patient was sent for 2-D echocardiogram. Doppler echocardiography showed a left atrial myxoma, 5.2x5.1x2.1 cm in size, which originated from the inferior inter-atrial septum and prolapsed into the left ventricle (Figure 7A). On the basis of the above findings, the final diagnosis was left atrial myxoma with multiple myxomatous cerebral (oncotic) aneurysms. Then the patient was sent for cardiac surgery for removal of that myxoma. The histopathological examination of the specimen revealed findings of myxoma in the form of spindle-shaped lipidic cells in a loose myxoid stroma (Figure 7B). The patient was lost for follow-up, so control echocardiogram was not performed.
Now, one year later, the patient presented with syncope. Recent computed tomography showed infarcts (not visible one year before) in the head of the right caudate nucleus and the right high parietal region, and chronic infarct in the left gangliocapsular area (Figure 8A, 8B). CT angiography showed tortuous, dilated and fusiform left MCA (Figure 9A) and multiple aneurysms in bilateral MCA and both vertebral arteries (Figure 9B).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4634163/,3,images/PMC4/PMC463/PMC4634163_01
PMC5072139_01,PMC5072139,Female,33.0,"A 33 year-old woman presented with a mass in her upper abdomen. She first palpated the lesion two and a half years ago after undergoing a caesarean section. Recently she noticed an increase in the size of the mass and referred to the clinic. She denied any associated symptoms including fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting or pain. She had no underlying diseases. The only surgery she had undergone was the mentioned caesarean section two. She denied taking any medications, smoking or alcohol consumption and her family history was unremarkable.
She was normotensive with a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, her pulse rate was 76 per minute, her respiratory rate was 16 per minute and her oral temperature was 36.8  C. Her physical examination was unremarkable except for a firm, non-mobile fullness palpated in her epigastric region and left upper quadrant of the abdomen without any tenderness or abdominal guarding. The extent of the mass could not be established. Laboratory results were as follows: HGB = 11, Cr = 1, CA19-9 = 0.6, CEA = 76.6 and CA125 = 78.7.
A Computed Tomography Scan (CT) was performed for the patient that revealed a large retroperitoneal tumor posterior to the pancreas and anterior to the left kidney, extending to the pelvic cavity. The stomach and the pancreas were pushed forward and the mass was compressing on the small bowel loops. The tumor contained calcifications along with heterogeneous cystic lesions measuring 210 x 154 mm (Fig. 1B). Pancreatic pseudocyst and ovarian tumors were the most probable diagnoses suspected based on the findings of the CT scan.
The patient underwent laparotomy and through a midline incision above and below the umbilicus exploration was performed. A huge retroperitoneal mass was observed. Liver, spleen, small intestine, peritoneum and the pelvic cavity were thoroughly examined for metastases and none were found. No ascites were observed and based on the findings a decision was made for total excision of the tumor. First the adhesions were released and the tumor was separated from the descending colon, splenic flexure, transverse colon, surrounding tissues and mesocolon, gerota fascia, posterior aspect of the pancreas, splenic and superior mesenteric veins, medial aspect of inferior vena cava, aorta, left ureter and left renal vein. Finally a 35 x 35 cm mass was totally excised and sent to the lab for pathologic evaluations (Fig. 1A).
The patient was followed 2 weeks after the surgery, during which she developed no significant complications. Pathology assessment reported a neoplasm composed of various tissues including skin, respiratory mucosa, gastrointestinal mucosa, fat, smooth muscle, hyaline cartilage, peripheral nerves and ganglions along with vast areas indicative of previous bleeding with aggregation of hemosiderin. The final diagnosis was made as a mature cystic teratoma with no evidence of malignancy or immature components. Fig. 2 depicts the timeline of the patient's presentation to her final diagnosis.

PMC8591098_01,PMC8591098,Female,68.0,"In April 2018, a 68-year-old woman was referred to our center presenting with rapidly progressive dyspnea. During the previous 12 years, she had been hospitalized more than 100 times for severe heart failure and shock. These episodes were so dramatic that even transient anger could cause acute-onset of dyspnea and shock. Additionally, she reported fatigue, dizziness, anorexia, vomiting, and a 5-kg weight loss during 1 month. Her past medical history revealed a 15-year history of seasonal dermatitis, intermittently treated with oral dexamethasone. On physical examination, she was notable for pallor, hypotension (86/46 mmHg), pulmonary rales, and lower extremities swelling. Laboratory tests were unremarkable except for hyponatremia (Na: 128 mmol/L) and elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro BNP: 6,343 pg/mL). In addition, her free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (FT3) levels were normal, while thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was increased (TSH: 11.04 mIU/L, normal TSH: 0.38-5.57 mIU/L). Her electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with complete left bundle branch block (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a dilated and severely hypokinetic left ventricle (LV 68 mm) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 33% (Figure 2), while coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery disease. Therefore, she was diagnosed with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, 3 days after receiving standard heart failure and antishock treatment all her symptoms and signs remained.
Given her long-term dexamethasone treatment and dramatic manifestations consistent with adrenal insufficiency, we tested her basal plasma cortisol and simultaneous corticotropin (ACTH) levels. It turned out that her basal plasma cortisol level was extremely low (0.65 mug/dL; normal 8 a.m. cortisol level: 10.4-26.4 mug/dL) and that ACTH level was low (4.32 pg/mL; normal 8 a.m. ACTH level: 6-40 pg/mL). Continuous cortisol monitoring revealed that her plasma cortisol was constantly deficient (Figure 3). Additionally, her abdominal enhanced computed tomography revealed atrophic bilateral adrenal glands (Figure 4), indicating long-standing and severe adrenal insufficiency. Further autoantibody assays were negative. In addition, her brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other pituitary hormones (growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin) levels were normal. Therefore, the final diagnosis was dilated cardiomyopathy with tertiary adrenal insufficiency.
In addition to previous normal saline, torasemide (10 mg i.v. twice daily), spironolactone (20 mg once daily), digoxin (0.125 mg once daily), dopamine (10 mug/kg/min), and norepinephrine infusion (0.3 mug/kg/min), hydrocortisone (50 mg) was administered intravenously every 6 h. Within 4 days, her blood pressure normalized, physical activity improved, edema resolved completely, and hyponatremia was corrected. Following that, normal saline and norepinephrine were discontinued, dopamine and intravenous hydrocortisone were gradually withdrawn in the next few days, and an oral hydrocortisone maintenance dose was instituted. Two weeks later, she recovered and was discharged on digoxin (0.125 mg once daily), bisoprolol (1.25 mg once daily), spironolactone (20 mg once daily), torasemide (10 mg once daily), and hydrocortisone (12.5 mg + 7.5 mg + 5.0 mg). During the follow-up period, her compliance and persistence with these medications remained excellent, and she had never experienced any episodes of heart failure and shock. We had tried to initiate low-dose candesartan (1 mg once daily) several times but failed, because it caused hypotension. Echocardiogram performed 18 months following hydrocortisone replacement therapy revealed mild improvement in EF and LV reverse remodeling (EF 35%, LV 64 mm), while her complete left bundle branch block remained. Unfortunately, she refused the implantation of defibrillator with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-D) and died of sudden cardiac death in May 2020.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8591098/,4,images/PMC8/PMC859/PMC8591098_01

His past medical history was unremarkable; however, weight loss of 17 kg in recent months as well as myalgia and fatigue were noted.
Examination revealed a bilateral best corrected visual acuity of 20/30. There was no color vision loss. The intraocular pressure values were within the normal range in both eyes. While the anterior chamber was quiet, mild to moderate vitritis was observed in both eyes. Despite the mildly hazy view, indirect ophthalmoscopy yielded no change in the posterior segments (Fig. 1 a-h). A fluorescein angiogram revealed no abnormality (Fig. 1 e, f).
Optical coherence tomography images displayed normal foveal architecture with a few hyper-reflective dots in the posterior vitreous of both eyes corresponding to the vitreous cells (Fig. 1 g, h). The initial diagnosis was bilateral intermediate uveitis.
A full systemic and laboratory work-up was performed in collaboration with a rheumatologist and pulmonologist. Lab investigations included a complete blood count; analysis of serum liver enzymes, renal function, electrolytes, inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein), angiotensin-converting enzyme, and rheumatological markers (antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and rheumatoid factor); infection screening (syphilis and tuberculosis); brain magnetic resonance imaging; and chest radiography. Treatment with 40 mg oral prednisolone was initiated once an infectious etiology was excluded. Finally, positron emission tomography (PET-CT) scanning was used to explore the possibility of sarcoidosis or malignancy.
The PET-CT images revealed an increased uptake of 2-(fluorine-18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose in area of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes (Fig. 2). To determine the nature of the primary tumor, a biopsy was performed during a bronchoscopy. SCLC (T2N3M0) was established the histopathological examination. The patient was then referred to an oncologist for additional treatment.
After 2 weeks of oral steroid therapy, a subsequent examination yielded a visual acuity of 20/20 and very little lingering bilateral haze (Fig. 3). The patient began a course of chemotherapy, and oral steroid treatment was tapered and terminated. The final diagnosis was bilateral paraneoplastic vitritis.

An intraabdominal mass was found on abdominal computed tomography (CT), and he was referred for further evaluation. Both parents had died of hepatic cirrhosis. On physical examination, he was afebrile, with mild tenderness in the upper abdomen and with massive distention. Routine blood tests showed: WBC 24,300/mul, Hb 7.3 g/dl, FDP 123.7 mug/ml, D-dimer 111.2 ng/ml, T-Bili 1.24 mg/dl, AST 35 mU/ml, LDH 810 mU/ml, ALP 392 mU/ml, ChE 99 mU/ml, CRP 18.28 mg/dl, HBs antigen negative, HCV antibody positive, CEA 1.2 ng/ml, and CA19-9 5 U/ml. Repeat CT showed a large solitary heterogeneous mass, 25 cm in diameter, in the left upper quadrant with evidence of intratumoral bleeding and irregular enhancement peripherally (arrowhead, fig. 1). There was no clear distinction between the mass and the left lateral segment of the liver. The anterior wall of the stomach was diffusely adherent to the posterior side of the mass. The left side of the diaphragm was also invaded (arrowhead, fig. 2). The tumor seemed to originate from the gastric wall and was suspected to be a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Needle biopsy revealed only a few spindle-shaped atypical cells.
Surgery was performed due to persistent anemia and exacerbation of abdominal pain. Intraoperative findings revealed that the tumor was densely adherent to the lateral segment of the liver, gallbladder, anterior wall of the stomach, left side of the diaphragm and parietal peritoneum. Lateral segmentectomy, total gastrectomy, cholecystectomy and partial resection of the diaphragm and parietal peritoneum were performed, with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The tumor measured 20x15x8 cm. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of histologic sections of the resected specimen showed a malignant neoplasm with undifferentiated spindle cells. Malignant cells with glandular formations similar to intrahepatic bile ducts showed a transition from a differentiated component to an undifferentiated one between the tumor and the liver. Tumor cells invaded the intrahepatic bile duct and replaced normal bile duct epithelium. The carcinomatous component (<10% of the cells) stained positive for cytokeratin-7 and cytokeratin-19, but negative for hepatocytes. The sarcomatous component (~90% of the cells) stained positive for vimentin and keratin-1, but negative for cytokeratin-7, cytokeratin-19 and hepatocytes. The adenocarcinoma appeared to be derived from the intrahepatic bile duct with transformation to sarcomatous cells. The final diagnosis was cholangiocarcinoma with sarcomatous changes.

She had been treated with thyroid hormone (Puran  T4, 75 mug), an anti-hypertensive agent (the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor Enalapril , 20 mg), an antiarrhythmic drug (Diltiazem , 90 mg), and acetylsalicylic acid (200 mg). She reported use of oral contraceptives for over 30 years. She had no history of smoking, drinking, drug abuse or family history of liver disease.
On physical examination, the liver was palpable to 6.5 cm from the right costal, and 10 cm from the appendix xiphoid; it was painless, and had a rugged and hard consistency. Laboratory studies revealed the following: red blood cells, 3,690,000/mm3; hemoglobin, 11.7 g/dL; hematocrit, 35%; platelets, 278,000/mm3; cholesterol, 186 mg/dL; triglycerides, 70 mg/dL; glucose, 85 mg/dL; TSH, 2.8 U/mL; serum creatinine, 0.7 mg/dL; ALT, 47 U/L; AST, 29 U/L; GGT, 23 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 138 U/L; TB, 0.8 mg/dL; DB, 0.4 mg/dL; PT, 12 s; INR, 1.0; PTT, 29 s; folic acid, 11 mg/mL; alpha-fetoprotein, 2.08 ng/mL; iron, 106 mug/dL; vitamin B12, 210 pg/mL; ferritin, 170 mg/L; LDH, 384 IU/L; and CEA 2.4 ng/mL.
Abdominal ultrasound revealed an enlarged and heterogeneous liver that contained an expansive and heterogeneous lesion measuring 14 x 9.4 cm with poorly defined limits, including two echogenic nodular areas, measuring 6.3 and 3.2 cm, respectively. The gallbladder was not visualized.
Computed tomography (CT) of the upper abdomen (Figure 1) showed a heterogeneous lesion - measuring 15 x 14 x 10 cm - with a partially well-defined margin and hypodense permeating areas, some with attenuation values compatible with soft parts, and others with liquefaction located in the left liver lobe. After endovenous contrast injection, the lesion showed intense and non-homogeneous impregnation in the arterial and portal phases, with hypodense permeated areas located in the left lobe, notably parts II and III; these areas determined recoil and reduced the size of vascular structures adjacent to the liver. The injury also caused bulging of the border of adjacent liver tissue, causing a compressive effect on other abdominal structures, especially the stomach and pancreas.
Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the upper abdomen showed different components within the lesion. T2-weighted images in the peripheral region showed a discrete heterogeneous hyperintense signal, while the central portion was hypointense. In T1-weighted images, the signal in the periphery of the mass was similar to the muscle signal and the center of the lesion showed a signal that was clearly hypointense. Although impregnation of both components began in the arterial phase, the peripheral region showed a stronger signal during the arterial and portal phases, followed by signal decay in the late phase due to relatively rapid washout, indicative of hypervascularization. The center of the mass was far more intense in the late phase, probably due to slow flow through the vascular components (Figures 2 and 3).
Surgery and pathological analysis revealed a hepatic segment measuring 17.5 x 14 x 8 cm and weighing 1200 g that contained a 15 x 9 cm brown tumor with ill-defined limits. The tumor had a gelatinous component and showed hemorrhaged, necrotic, and cystic areas. The final diagnosis was TA.

Physical examination revealed swelling in the left lower extremity, with a circumference of 29 cm ( Figure 1A ), local skin temperature, and limited mobility, while the right lower extremity had a circumference of 20 cm with normal mobility. After admission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and enhanced CT scans of the lower limb were complete, and the results revealed a soft tissue mass in the thigh, measuring approximately 8.25 cm x 8.72 cm x 7.86 cm, with possible hemorrhage ( Figures 2A, B . Subsequently, an ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy of the left thigh mass was performed under general anesthesia, and the histopathological results ( Figure 3 ) suggested a soft tissue tumor with spindle cells. Immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies showed Desmin (weakly positive), CD34 (partially positive), EMA (focally positive), Pan-Trk (weakly positive), Vimentin (positive), INI1 (present), BRG1 (present), CD56 (partially positive), MyoD1 (negative), CD99 (positive), CK (AE1/AE3) (focally positive), Myogenin (negative), Ki-67 (approximately 30% positive), and SMA (positive) ( Figure 4 ). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed ETV6 gene breakage ( Figure 5 ). High-throughput sequencing for gene rearrangement detection and targeted drug testing showed ETV6-NTRK3 rearrangement, and larotrectinib, entrectinib, and crizotinib were sensitive. The final diagnosis was infantile fibrosarcoma. At 20 days of age, oral larotrectinib (Vitrakvi, 50 ml/1.0 g) was started at a dose of 22 mg/dose twice a day (3.64 kg body weight, 100 mg/m2, twice a day).

One month of follow-up showed a further reduction in circumference to 20 cm ( Figure 1C ), and ultrasound B revealed a mass size of 6.0 cm x 5.0 cm x 3.0 cm.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10412926/,2,images/PMC1/PMC104/PMC10412926_01
PMC4712462_01,PMC4712462,Male,56.0,"A 56-year-old male was referred to our hospital for surgical resection of a posterior mediastinal tumor in July 2014. A local doctor had originally diagnosed the tumor in 2005, and it had gradually increased in size until March 2014. The patient did not have any health problems or symptoms suggestive of a history of hematologic disorder or chronic anemia. Laboratory tests for tumor detection, including those implementing tumor markers, were within normal limits. A chest roentgenogram and computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor mass shadow in the right lower posterior mediastinum. The tumor was 4.3 cm in diameter and was evident on the side of the T9 thoracic vertebrae (Fig. 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the signal intensity of the tumor was low in the T1 weighted image and disproportionately high in the T2 weighted image (Fig. 2).
Differential diagnoses included neurogenic tumor, malignant lymphoma, pleural mesothelioma, lipoma, liposarcoma, or an extra-adrenal myelolipoma. We performed tumor resection by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Surgery revealed that the tumor in the posterior mediastinum was a well-encapsulated, elastic, soft, and dark red mass (Fig. 3).
Histopathological findings of the resected specimens revealed a predominantly mature adipose tissue with hematopoietic tissue comprised of erythroblasts, megakaryocytes, and granulocytes (Fig. 4).
Although extramedullary hematopoiesis was considered as a differential diagnosis, the final diagnosis was a mediastinal extra-adrenal myelolipoma. The patient was discharged with no complications on the fifth postoperative day, and he has been well for 12 months postoperatively.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712462/,3,images/PMC4/PMC471/PMC4712462_01
PMC8695756_01,PMC8695756,Female,77.0,"A 77-year-old woman was hospitalized in the cardiology department due to atrial fibrillation. Contraindications were excluded, and atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation was performed on an optional schedule. However, abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan found a circular and low-density lesion in the Segment 4 of the liver with unclear border, approximately 15 mmx 12 mm in size, which was mild progressive enhanced in the arterial phase and portal phase. HCC was suspected, but no hepatic cirrhosis and history of hepatitis (Figure 1). Tumor markers, including CEA, CA199, CA125, AFP, were within normal range, hepatitis panel was negative, and hepatic function was normal.
To confirm the diagnosis, the patient underwent further examinations. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed one nodule in the segment 7, one nodule in the segment 5, and two nodules in the segment 4 of the liver (4, 6, 17, and 6 mm in diameter), respectively. The larger one was located in the segment 4 of liver, with hypointense on T1-weighted images (T1WI) and hyperintense on T2-weighted images (T2WI), which showed significant enhancement on the arterial phase and slight washout on the portal phase. In the delayed phase, the edge of the tumor was underscored as a circular enhancement which is unsimilar to the enhancement method of dynamic CT. It showed a significant restriction of diffusion on diffusion weighted images (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Other lesions in segments 7 and 5 showed the same hemodynamic characteristics as the tumor in segment 4 ( Figure 2). Based on MRI findings, it is considered as tumorous lesions of the liver.
For further differential diagnosis, the patient underwent positron emission tomography-computer tomography (PET-CT) examination, founding that the segment 4 of liver had a slightly low-density lesion with increased uptake of 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG), and SUVmax of early and delayed enhancement imaging was 4.81 and 5.24, respectively. The detention index was 8.9%. However, the lesions in segments 7 and 5 of the liver showed no significant increase in FDG uptake ( Figure 3). As all images suggested HCC, the medial segment of the liver was finally surgically removed.
Surgical removal of a piece of left medial lobe of liver tissue, about 6 cm x 4 cm x 2.5 cm in size, the cut surface shows an expanded lumen structure, and a gray-white mass in the liver parenchyma. The size is about 2.5 x 2cm, part of the boundary is unclear, and the texture is soft. The HE-stained sections under low-power microscope showed that massive lymphoid tissues proliferated in the lesion and formed massive lymphoid follicles, and the peripheral lymphoid tissues of the lesion grew around the small bile ducts, but no clear lymphoepithelial lesions were seen. The interfollicular area is dominated by small lymphocytes, and many plasma cells can be seen. In the lymphatic tissue, there were homogeneous red-stained collagen-like deposits around some small blood vessels. Immunohistochemical results were as follows: Bcl-2(-), Bcl-6(germinal center +), CD10(germinal center +), CD20(+), CD23(+), CD3(+), Ki-67(germinal center +), CD5(+), CyclinD1(-), TDT(-), kappa/lambda ratio about 2:1. EBV negative by qRT-PCR method (Figure 4). A genetic study of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) clonality on the DNA of tumor tissues was performed using capillary electrophoresis method, which was reported previously. The results showed that no clonal IgH gene rearrangement was detected: IGH (-), IGK (-), IGL (-). Therefore, the possibility of extranodal marginal-zone lymphoma (MALT) was ruled out, and the final diagnosis was RLH. Combined with imaging, pathology, and clinical manifestations, the clinical diagnosis was multifocal RLH in the liver. Three months after the operation, a re-examination of the abdominal ultrasound showed no signs of recurrence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8695756/,22,images/PMC8/PMC869/PMC8695756_01
PMC6685700_01,PMC6685700,Male,56.0,"A 56 year old retired Navy sailor, known with a remote history of gastric carcinoma, was referred to our clinic by the medical oncology team for a slowly growing penile mass, suspicious of penile carcinoma. The lesion was first noted by the patient 3 months before presentation. Over this period, the patient experienced increasing penile pain requiring use of narcotics and complained of fatigue, anorexia and progressive weight lost as well as increasing obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms. Additionally, the patient suffers from erectile dysfunction and had been sexually abstinent for over 10 years. He had no prior history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
On physical examination, an indurated ulcero-necrotic penile mass of 4 cm involving the glans and the distal penile shaft was noted, along with a partial phimosis. The groin examination revealed bilateral mobile painless lymph nodes of less than 2 cm. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan demonstrated the presence of a 4 cm hypermetabolic penile mass along with multiple hypermetabolic bilateral inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes of less than 2 cm (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). These findings were suspicious of penile carcinoma.
Based on the strong suspicion of penile carcinoma, a penile biopsy was first proposed to the patient, but declined. Given the severe intractable penile pain and considering that the patient had been abstinent for over 10 years, the decision was taken to perform a partial penectomy for palliative and diagnostic purposes (Fig. 3). Pathological assessment of the specimen revealed the presence of polymorphous, granulomatous, epitheloid inflammatory infiltrate with giant cells, associated with a focal abscess and a prominent vascular involvement (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). No evidence of malignancy was identified. Specific tests to identify an infectious cause were negative, including histological (silver stain) and immunohistochemical search for Treponema pallidum.
One month after surgery, the patient developed neurological symptoms including visual disturbances, migraine and weakness. A nontreponemal rapid plasma regain (RPR) test (Macro-Vue RPR Card, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) revealed high titers (1:256). On lumbar puncture (LP), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a WBC count of 80 x 106/L (81% mononucleated cells, 11% neutrophils), a normal glucose level of 3.6 mmol/L, and elevated protein (0.69 g/L). A CSF RPR test was positive at 1:4. HIV testing was negative. On follow-up questionnaire, the patient admitted having several sexual intercourses with European and Caribbean sex workers in the 80's. The final diagnosis was tertiary syphilis with gumma and neurosyphilis. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin G for 14 days, followed by a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin. He is presently doing well with no residual symptoms. Follow-up nontreponemal testing showed adequate response and a PET-CT performed 9 months after initiation of therapy showed complete regression of lymphadenopathies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6685700/,3,images/PMC6/PMC668/PMC6685700_01
PMC6014644_01,PMC6014644,Female,56.0,"A 56-year-old otherwise healthy woman walked into the emergency room of our hospital with worsening abdominal pain for 4 days. Her body temperature was 38.1C; blood pressure, 92/54 mmHg; and heart rate, 107 beats/min. Physical examination revealed tenderness and muscular defense around the lower abdomen. Blood tests showed elevation in white blood cell count (11,160/mul) and C-reactive protein level (5.4 mg/dl). Levels of CEA and CA19-9 were within normal ranges. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed an irregularly shaped tumor in the lower abdomen measuring approximately 9.5 cm x 9 cm x 5.5 cm (Fig. 1a, b). The tumor wall was thick and enhanced with intravenous contrast material, suggesting hypervascularity. An air-fluid level was contained in the tumor. Free air and ascites were not observed. Because her general condition was not bad, and the CT scan findings did not suggest peritonitis, intravenous administration of antibiotics was chosen as initial treatment. In addition, preoperative examinations including upper and lower endoscopies and magnetic resonance imaging were planned. However, because her clinical symptoms and laboratory data did not respond to the treatment, and because her status was accompanied with high fever after admission, an emergency surgical procedure was performed on the 6th day after her admission.
Diagnostic laparoscopy was initially performed. Slightly turbid ascites were observed and collected for the culture test. The procedure also showed that the tumor was movable and was expected to be resectable. Therefore, open exploration was performed through a midline incision. The laparotomy revealed that the tumor arose from the jejunum wall, and was located 20 cm from the ligament of Treitz (Fig. 2). Loose adhesion without invasion was observed and the tumor was easily separable with blunt dissection. Macroscopic perforation was not observed to be apparent. Partial resection of the jejunum with the tumor and sampling of some nearby lymph nodes were performed, and a small portion of the tumor was sent for frozen section, which revealed proliferation of spindle-shaped tumor cells. Thus, this patient was diagnosed as having a mesenchymal tumor of the jejunum, and lymphadenectomy was omitted.
At macroscopic observation, the excised tumor, measuring 9 cm in diameter, was irregularly shaped with a soft tumor wall, and had a central cavity containing a large amount of pus (Fig. 3a, b). There was a small fistula between the cavity and the intestinal lumen (Fig. 3c, d). The culture test of the ascites was negative for bacteria.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed proliferation of spindle-shaped tumor cells. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the tumor cells were positive for c-KIT, CD34, SMA, and negative for Desmin, S-100. Mitotic count was 6/50 High Power Fields. Metastasis to the sampled lymph nodes was not observed. Therefore, the final diagnosis was high-risk GIST of the jejunum. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and she was discharged home on the 10th postoperative day. Thereafter, adjuvant imatinib mesylate was administered.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6014644/,7,images/PMC6/PMC601/PMC6014644_01
PMC4065430_01,PMC4065430,Female,32.0,"A 32-year-old female patient reported with a chief complaint of a large swelling in her right back teeth region since several months. Clinical examination revealed a 2 x 1.5 cm2 in dimensions, well-circumscribed, lobulated and pinkish mass on the right retromolar area [Figure 1]. The swelling was soft in consistency and nontender on palpation. There was no paresthesia, facial asymmetry or regional lymphadenopathy noted. Normal complement of dentition was seen. Provisional diagnosis of irritational fibroma was made. Differential diagnosis included peripheral ossifying fibroma, peripheral giant cell granuloma, pyogenic granuloma, mucocele, lipoma, other benign mesenchymal tumors and benign salivary gland neoplasms. Following written consent from the patient, the growth including the normal surrounding tissue was excised under local anesthesia. Postoperative period was uneventful.
Excisional biopsy specimen was fixed in 10% formalin and sent to the Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology for histopathological examination. Histopathologically, hematoxylin and eosin stained sections revealed a well-circumscribed tumor composed of granular cells that were arranged in solid sheets, alveoli, nests, columns or cords with scattered focal clear cells throughout the tumor tissue, separated by a delicate fibrovascular network [Figure 2]. On higher magnification, the tumor cells were polyhedral to round with distinct cell borders. Abundant cytoplasm, with centrally located nucleus and little mitotic activity were seen [Figure 3]. Features were in favor of oncocytoma rather than fibroma. To confirm the diagnosis, phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin (PTAH) staining was carried out, which revealed abundant coarse cytoplasmic granules that correspond to abundance of mitochondria [Figure 4]. The final diagnosis was determined as oncocytoma of minor salivary glands of the retromolar area.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4065430/,4,images/PMC4/PMC406/PMC4065430_01
PMC5974677_01,PMC5974677,Male,34.0,"A 34-year-old martial arts instructor presented with a chief complaint of progressive left hip pain of insidious onset and approximately 8-year duration. The pain was constant and localized to the left hip and groin, particularly with prolonged sitting and walking, with radiation to the knee. The patient denied any antecedent trauma or major hip injuries since childhood. Past medical, family, and social history were unremarkable. Conservative management including over-the- counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, activity modification, and physical therapy had only provided minimal relief.
Initial orthopedic examination revealed the patient walking with an antalgic gait associated with anterior left hip pain. Anterior impingement testing (internal rotation and adduction during passive flexion of the knee to 90 ) was positive, reproducing the patient's symptoms. Patrick's test revealed moderate groin pain and restricted sacroiliac joints. Lower limb neurologic examination was unremarkable. A pre-operative Harris Hip Score of 60 was recorded.
Plain film radiographs were obtained and revealed bilateral hip joint osteoarthritis, with osteophytosis, joint space narrowing, and subchondral cystic changes in the left hip (Fig. 1). A camtype deformity of the femur, pincer deformity of the acetabulum, and a calcified labrum were also observed.
Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed advanced left hip osteoarthritis. Based on patient history, age, and examination findings, the final diagnosis was left hip impingement and osteoarthritis. Following a lengthy discussion regarding BHR versus THA, the patient decided to proceed with BHR, due to his highly active lifestyle.
Surgery was performed with the assistance of Intellijoint HIP  (Intellijoint Surgical, Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada), a 3D mini- optical navigation device currently approved for use in posterior, lateral, and direct anterior approaches in THA. This navigation tool utilizes optical technology, infrared light, and microelectronics to deliver measurements for cup position and leg length in real time which are made accessible to the surgeon on a workstation monitor located just outside of the sterile field. The device has received clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration for use in primary hip arthroplasty but has not been evaluated for use in hip resurfacing procedures.
The use of the device in the presented case followed the surgical workflow for the posterior THA application, which has been described previously. In brief, the navigation system contains a camera, probe, and tracker located within the sterile field. The camera is magnetically attached to a pelvic platform that sits atop two surgical screws inserted into the ipsilateral iliac crest. The tracker is similarly attached to a small femoral platform installed laterally on the greater trochanter through a single screw. The camera captures the movements and position of the tracker and relays data in real time to a computer workstation placed outside of the sterile field. In addition to the femoral platform, the tracker can be fixed to various other objects (e.g., impactor and surgical probe) during surgery to provide data regarding their position and orientation (Fig. 2).
The patient was placed in the lateral decubitus position per normal surgical protocols and fixed with rigid pelvic fixation. The affected hip area was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Using an 11-blade, two stab incisions were made over the iliac crest. Two threaded pins were inserted into the crest and confirmed to be placed in bone. The pelvic platform was installed on the pins, tightened, and the camera attached. A standard posterolateral incision was made through the skin, and dissection was carried down through subcutaneous tissue to the underlying fascia achieving hemostasis where necessary. The femoral platform was then installed on the greater trochanter. The femoral head was dislocated and sized to 50mm without evidence of notching. An anterior capsulotomy was made to further release the femur. The acetabulum was then exposed with a plan for a 56 mm cup. The labrum was excised with a long-handle knife, and the acetabular rim and cotyloid fossa were exposed. The acetabulum was reamed in accordance with the pre-operative plan, using the navigation tool to intermittently monitor the orientation of the acetabular cup component. Following copious irrigation, the final cup was impacted into position, confirmed by the navigation tool at 36  inclination and 24  anteversion. Following the procedure, the patient was returned to the supine position to verify all lower extremity compartments which were soft and compressible and to confirm intact distal pulses and leg length restoration. An anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiograph was taken in the operating room (OR) and reviewed before transfer. The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
Standard, post-operative AP pelvic radiographs were obtained and analyzed using TraumaCad (Brainlab, Chicago, USA). Final cup inclination and anteversion values were measured in triplicate and averaged. Final cup position was calculated from radiographs as 39.0  inclination and 24.7  anteversion (Fig. 3). Pre-operative leg length differential was measured on the preoperative AP radiograph at 3 mm and was restored to 0 mm following BHR.
Post-operatively, the patient was doing extremely well and was pain free with no physical limitations. At his 12-week follow-up visit, a Harris Hip Score of 92 was recorded, showing an improvement from his pre-operative score of 60.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5974677/,3,images/PMC5/PMC597/PMC5974677_01
PMC6359751_01,PMC6359751,Male,34.0,"A 34-year-old male of mixed Japanese and European descent presented with a several month history of lymphadenopathy, arising as a left sided cervical mass. In addition, he had an IgM kappa paraprotein of 30 g/L. He underwent a fine needle aspirate then excision of the left cervical node and a bone marrow biopsy. Examination of the lymph node showed partial effacement of normal nodal architecture by a lymphoma with a marginal zone pattern. There were no proliferation centres. Flow cytometry (on the FNA and the excision specimen) demonstrated a B-cell clone expressing CD19, CD20 (see Fig. 1), CD5, CD38, partial CD23, partial FMC7 and moderate kappa light chain. The cells were negative for CD10 and CD200.
Immunohistochemical staining showed the neoplastic B-lymphocytes in the widened marginal zone regions were positive for CD20, CD79a, CD5 (weak) and bcl-2. The cells were negative for CD10, bcl-6, cyclin D1, SOX-11 and CD23. Around the periphery of the expanded neoplastic marginal zone B-cells there was an associated population of neoplastic plasma cells which demonstrated immunohistochemical evidence of kappa light chain restriction. CD21 and CD23 highlighted expanded follicular dendritic cell networks. The Ki67 proliferation rate was around 10%. Molecular testing showed no evidence of a MYD88 L265P mutation.
On the basis of the clinicoradiologic presentation, the morphological appearance and the immunophenotypic and molecular findings the final diagnosis was determined to be nodal MZL with aberrant CD5 positivity.
Conventional GTG-band karyotype analysis was performed from both the lymph node and bone marrow biopsy using standard protocols.
FISH studies were performed using the Vysis CLL probe set which consists of the following locus specific probes: ATM (11q22.3), TP53 (17p13.1), D12Z3 (12p11.1-q11.1), D13S319 (13q14.3) and LAMP1 (13q34). The Vysis break apart IGH (14q32) probe and the Vysis dual-fusion CCND1 (11q13)/IGH probe (14q32) were also used. In addition, an Empire Genomics break-apart probe CCND2 (12p13) was set up. Subsequent to this analysis and to determine if MYCN was involved in this rearrangement, a break-apart probe was created by combining the Vysis MYCN (2p24) locus specific probe combined with a custom made Empire Genomics probe RP11-542H15 (also at 2p24). Processing was performed according to the probe manufacturer's instructions.
The karyotype reports were written in accordance with the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature.
Chromosome analysis of the patient's lymph node showed an abnormal cell line in 7/10 cells. There was an apparently balanced translocation between the short arm of one chromosome 2 at band p24 and the long arm of one chromosome 14 at band q32 (see Fig. 2). In addition to this, there was gain of one additional copy of chromosomes 3, 7 and 18.
Interphase FISH showed no imbalance or rearrangement of ATM, TP53, D12Z3, D13S319, LAMP1, CCND1 or CCND2 loci. Due to the cytogenetic findings of a rearrangement involving chromosome 14, metaphase FISH using the IGH probe was performed. The IGH probe showed a break-apart signal with the 5' IGH signal on the derivative chromosome 2, the 3' IGH signal remained on the derivative chromosome 14 (see Fig. 3).
Metaphase and interphase FISH using both the custom made Empire Genomics RP11-542H15 and the Vysis MYCN probe in a single hybridisation to form a break-apart probe showed that the MYCN probe had been translocated to the derivative chromosome 14 (see Fig. 4).
The same abnormalities were detected in 6/20 cells of the bone marrow aspirate from this patient confirming that infiltration into the bone marrow had occurred.
The karyotype from the LN was reported as: 49,XY,t(2;14)(p24;q32),+3,+7,+18[7]/46,XY[3].ish t(2;14)(MYCN-,RP11-542H15+;MYCN+,3'RP11-542H15-)[4],(3'IGH-,5'IGH+,3'IGH+,5'IGH-)[7].nuc ish (MYCN, RP11-542H15)x2(MYCN sep RP11-542H15x1)[169/200],(5'CCND2,3'CCND2)x2(5'CCND2 con 3'CCND2x2)[200]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6359751/,3,images/PMC6/PMC635/PMC6359751_01
PMC7364248_01,PMC7364248,Male,24.0,"A 24-year-old man was admitted to a local hospital with a 2-day history of a fever and severe abdominal colic. He had been aware of nausea and anorexia for the past month. Until then, he had been well, with no relevant medical history. He had been employed as a construction worker for two years. On admission, he was conscious and alert, and his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.6  C; pulse rate, 82 bpm with regular rhythm; blood pressure, 122/76 mmHg; respiration rate, 12 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% (ambient air). On a physical examination, he was pale with anemic palpebral conjunctivae and had diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs. Findings of other medical examinations were normal; in particular, no neurologic deficit was detected. A complete blood count revealed normocytic anemia; the hemoglobin level was 7.3 g/dL (normal range: 12.0-16.0 g/dL) with a mean corpuscular volume of 86.3 fL (normal range: 80.0-100.0 fL) and a reticulocyte count of 2.81x104/muL (normal range: 4.00-8.00x104/muL). The white blood cell and platelet counts were normal. The serum iron, unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), folate, vitamin B12, and haptoglobin levels were normal. The blood zinc and copper levels were normal, and the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatinine were also within the normal ranges. However, the levels of total bilirubin [T-Bil; 2.1 mg/dL (normal range: 0.23-1.2 mg/dL)], aspartate aminotransferase [AST; 56 U/L (normal range: 13-33 U/L)], alanine aminotransferase [ALT; 63 U/L (normal range: 8-42 U/L)], gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT; 104 U/L (normal range: 11-58 U/L)], and ferritin 641.9 ng/mL (normal range: 30.0-400.0 ng/mL) were elevated. Serum tests for hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus as well as autoimmune diseases gave negative results. Fecal immunochemical testing for hemoglobin was negative. These data are shown in Table.
Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated no abnormalities. Non-contrast-enhanced whole-body computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple small, high-density areas thought to be lead particles in the stomach and small intestine, but no marked free air or ascites was noted. However, no abnormalities were detected in the respiratory tract (Fig. 1). Gastroscopy showed chronic non-atrophic gastritis, and colonoscopy demonstrated no abnormality. Wireless video capsule endoscopy revealed multiple ulcerations of the small intestine (Fig. 2). After about 30 days of symptomatic therapy, such as analgesics and fluid maintenance, the patient's clinical condition had not improved, so he was transferred to our hospital.
We then reassessed the patient's occupational history in detail and found that he had been engaged in repainting an iron bridge, involving scraping, sanding, and heat treatment with an electric iron device for two months before the onset of symptoms and had never been engaged in such work until then. During this work, he had worn a simple paper mask, and not a more sophisticated respiratory protection device. Furthermore, he had commonly smoked cigarettes at work without first washing his hands. We also reassessed the findings of the patient's physical examination and peripheral blood smear. This revealed a blue-purplish line bordering the upper gums, referred to as Burton's line (Fig. 3), and basophilic stippling of erythrocytes after May-Giemsa staining (Fig. 4). The levels of urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid (delta-ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) as well as free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) were assessed for the differential diagnosis of acute porphyria. The levels of urine delta-ALA and FEP were elevated at 118.1 mg/L (normal range, <5.0 mg/L) and 258 mug/dL/RBC (normal range, 30-86 mug/dL/RBC), respectively. However, the urine PBG level was only slightly elevated [4.3 mg/day (normal range, <2.0 mg/day)]. Occupational lead poisoning was highly suspected, so the blood and urine levels of lead were examined. This revealed an elevated blood lead level of 100 mug/dL [normal range, <20 mug/dL (values over 20 mug/dL in adults are considered toxic)] and a urine lead level of 337.4 mug/L (normal range, <25.0 mug/L) (Table).
The final diagnosis was lead poisoning due to occupational exposure, and chelation therapy was initiated immediately. Edetate calcium disodium (CaEDTA) was given orally at a dose of 2,000 mg per day for 5 days every 2 to 4 weeks. After the introduction of chelation therapy, the patient's abdominal colic and anorexia, hemoglobin level, and liver dysfunction promptly improved. The blood lead level also improved after four rounds of treatment (Fig. 5). Unfortunately, wireless video capsule endoscopy performed to evaluate the effect of treatment yielded no information.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7364248/,2,images/PMC7/PMC736/PMC7364248_01
PMC8369477_01,PMC8369477,Female,43.0,"A 43-year-old female with the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma treated with nivolumab was reported for a 18F-FDG PET/CT scan to exclude disease progression shortly after COVID-19 vaccination.
The timeline of the history of the patient is presented in Figure 1. She was diagnosed of a primary cutaneous melanoma of the right thigh in June 2015. The patient was previously healthy, with no history of other malignancies, surgery, or medication. There was no personal or family history of melanoma. The lesion was removed, and the final diagnosis was: cutaneous melanoma, BRAF wild-type, pT2aN0M0. In January 2019, a recurrence of the disease in form of the subcutaneous and brain metastases was diagnosed with the use of CT. A single cerebral metastasis was confirmed by MRI. After two weeks, nivolumab treatment was initiated, with a dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks. After the first dose of nivolumab, the cyberknife radiotherapy of the brain metastasis was performed. After two months of systemic treatment, all subcutaneous metastases disappeared; however six new brain metastases were detected in another MRI. All these new lesions were subsequently treated with cyberknife. The patient continued the nivolumab therapy beyond progression. Thereafter, during nivolumab treatment, she developed a further disease progression in the brain (04.2019, 05.2019, 01.2020, 12.2020). With each progression, one or two new brain metastases were found in the MRI. These lesions did not exceed 1 cm and were asymptomatic. After each occurrence, the cerebral metastases were treated with cyberknife. All extracerebral metastases were still in regression until December 2020 when some metabolically active lymph nodes in the right iliac region were detected in a PET/CT scan (PET1). In January 2021, a robot-assisted right iliac lymphadenectomy was performed, and the metastatic character of the iliac lymph nodes was histologically confirmed.
In February 2021, the patient underwent AZD1222 COVID-19 vaccination (first dose injected into her left arm). Four days later, another PET/CT was performed to exclude new extracerebral metastases (PET2). No sign of melanoma recurrence was found in the iliac lymph nodes or central nervous system. However, a metabolically active lymph node in the left axillary region was noted (Figure 2). The lymph node had the dimension of 9 x 7 mm, and the maximal standardized uptake value was 5.2. Additionally, an area of increased 18F-FDG accumulation was found in the left deltoid muscle that corresponded to the site of the recent vaccination. An inflammatory reaction to the injection was suspected to be responsible for the 18F-FDG accumulation in the axillary lymph node. However, in order to rule out a melanoma metastasis in the axillary lymph node, a follow-up PET/CT (PET3) was recommended 28 days later (March 2021, 32 days after vaccination). This scan did not present any 18F-FDG accumulation in the reported lymph node. The diameter of the node did not change. No other finding was reported, except for a focus of slightly increased 18F-FDG accumulation (diameter of 10 mm) in the right cerebellar lobe that had not been present in the PET2 scan. Fortunately, the subsequent MRI did not confirm any lesion in the cerebellum and did not show any other intracranial recurrence. However, further MRI monitoring of the central nervous system has been recommended.
To date (June, 2021), the patient does not present any active metastases (NED:no evidence of disease). Moreover, her performance status remains WHO 0 from the initial diagnosis until now. The treatment beyond disease progression was beneficial to the patient. In addition, at each disease progression, the patient was offered a second line treatment with ipilimumab, to which the patient did not consent due to its high toxicity and low efficacy. The patient was informed that there was insufficient evidence for the treatment with nivolumab beyond confirmed progression. Due to the fact that the patient did not consent to the ipilimumab treatment, as well as to the lack of a clinical trial, the continuation of nivolumab therapy was the only reasonable treatment option. In conclusion, the continued treatment beyond progression was decided due to the low tumor burden, the motivation of the patient and good performance status and, the lack of other treatment options.
The patient gave consent for the publication of her case.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8369477/,5,images/PMC8/PMC836/PMC8369477_01
PMC3658253_01,PMC3658253,Male,72.0,"A 72-year-old Caucasian man came to our attention after the appearance of an ulcerative lesion on the left nipple associated with an increased volume of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes. The patient underwent ultrasound examination, which showed a retroareolar lesion with irregular contours, a predominantly hypoechoic component, a maximum diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of 10 mm, and powerful Doppler vascular signals. A needle biopsy of the lesion was performed. The pathologist diagnosed a carcinoma with syringoid features. The patient underwent a radical mastectomy and ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection.
Histopathological examination showed the presence of a differentiated cutaneous adnexal carcinoma, with syringoid and microcystic morphology, ulcerated and infiltrating subcutaneous tissue with perineural invasion, and a desmoplastic stromal reaction (Figures 1-3). Metastases were found in four of the 16 lymph nodes removed. On immunohistochemical staining, the tumor cells expressed carcinoembryonic antigen (Figure 4), cytokeratin (Pan), cytokeratin 7, and p63 protein (Figure 5), and were found to be negative for S100 protein, estrogen, and progesterone receptors. The final diagnosis was SEC with axillary lymph node metastases.
After surgical intervention, the patient underwent a computed tomography scan and positron emission tomography that excluded the presence of distant metastases. Adjuvant radiotherapy at 50 Gray was performed in the axillary and sovraclavear omolateral area. After 26 months of follow-up, clinical and radiological investigation have excluded any tumor relapse.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3658253/,5,images/PMC3/PMC365/PMC3658253_01
PMC4336664_01,PMC4336664,Female,25.0,"A 25-year-old female patient reported with a complaint of watery discharge from her right cheek region since last 1 year. Patient gave history of fever and malaise associated with swelling in the right cheek region, which increased in size gradually and did not decrease for the next 15 days. Patient applied balm and hot fomentation over the swelling and the swelling started draining with purulent discharge over the cheek region. Patient consulted a local physician and was prescribed some medications for 5 days subsiding the swelling and pus discharge. Since then, watery discharge started from the same region. According to the patient, the discharge increased during meals. Patient received consultation from various places for the same but did not get any relief. Patient also consulted a local dentist for the same complain and underwent surgical extraction of the lower right third molar, which was impacted. Even 10 days after-the extraction, patient had no relief and then she was referred to our institution.
Patient gave no contributory medical history with a healthy familial background and no personal abusive habits. Extra-oral examination revealed a scar tissue on the right cheek on anterosuperior region of the angle of mandible, oval in shape and approximately 1 cm x 1.5 cm in size. The surrounding skin appeared to be normal. A small pinpoint opening (Figure 1) was seen just above the scar from which watery fluid discharged spontaneously which increased on sucking lemon. On palpation, all inspectory findings were confirmed. The scar was completely healed and attached to the underlying deeper structures. The discharged fluid was watery, non-sticky, and thin in consistency. Right submandibular lymph nodes were palpable, enlarged, freely movable and non-tender, measuring approximately 1 cm in size. Intraoral examination revealed healing extraction socket with 48 with no tenderness present on the same region. The parotid papilla appeared to be normal. Mild salivary flow was seen from right parotid papilla along with more flow from fistula on milking of right parotid gland and rest of the oral cavity showing normal wet ability with saliva (Figure 2).
Ultrasonographic examination revealed normal echostructure of the right parotid gland with smooth margins, giving no evidence of any solid or cystic lesion. A small collection was seen in the anteroinferior margin of the right parotid, which measured 5 mm x 3 mm approximately. The contents were anechoic, and a small 1.5 mm sinus tract was seen from the collection to the skin.
On radiographic examination with insertion of gutta percha point in the fistula revealed in the parotid region (Figure 3). Fistulography, as well as sialography, was performed using 70% urografin contrast media which revealed its relation with parotid duct. When the urografin solution was injected into the parotid duct intra-orally the solution came out from the fistulous tract extra-orally immediately without entering into the gland tissue. This was seen because of least resistance felt on this route. Hence, a false filling defect in radiograph was noted, and solution could not enter the gland because of direct communication of fistulous tract and duct (Figure 4). The final diagnosis was given as persistent parotid fistula with right parotid duct secondary to chronic suppurative parotitis.
Patient was taken under short general anesthesia; methylene blue ink was injected into the fistulous opening using a 26-gauge needle to identify the tract. An elliptical incision of 1 cm diameter was taken around the fistulous opening, which included the scar tissue. The skin island was then held with skin hooks and the subcutaneous tissue dissected until the fistulous tract containing dye was visible.
The fistulous tract was then traced proximally until it entered the thick parotid fascia. The fascia was incised, and the tract was traced up to the superficial lobe of the parotid. Superficial lobe of the parotid was carefully dissected, and fistulectomy was done after ligating the attachment of the fistulous tract to the Stenson's duct (Figure 5). Closure was done in two layers using vicryl 3-0 and nylon 4-0 sutures (Figure 6) followed by tight pressure dressing. Patient was discharged with oral amoxicillin with cloxacillin, diclofenac sodium, and cetirizine on third post-operative day. Sutures were removed on the 7th day. Regular follow-up was done for 1 year, the fistulous tract healed satisfactory (Figure 7) and no complain of recurrence was encountered by the patient. The salivary flow was also adequate and was periodically checked by sucking lime.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4336664/,7,images/PMC4/PMC433/PMC4336664_01
PMC10098003_01,PMC10098003,Female,31.0,"A 31-year-old woman diagnosed with SLE 12 years prior presented to our immunology clinic. She complained of a one-month history of general swelling of the whole body and diarrhea. Her SLE was not well-controlled and was predominantly hematological during her previous flares. She had a prior history of intolerance to hydroxychloroquine and was taking methylprednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil at the time of admission. She was positive for SARS-CoV-2 one month prior to admission without any symptom. Her review of systems was negative for underlying valvular disease, previous episodes of rheumatic fever, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and intravenous drug abuse.
On examination, the patient had normal vitals, was afebrile, and had generalized edema. A thorough cardiovascular evaluation was unremarkable with no cardiac murmurs and normal jugular venous pressure. Examination of the integumentary system did not show any purpura, splinter hemorrhage, oral ulcers, or alopecia. Notable initial laboratory findings were as follows: mild normocytic anemia with negative Coombs tests, thrombocytopenia (45 x 109 per liter), leukocytosis (17.12 x 109 per liter), decreased C3 levels (0.45 g/L), severe hypoalbuminemia (8.6 mg/L) without evidence of proteinuria or hematuria, within-normal range liver and renal function tests. Her procalcitonin level was mildly elevated (0.166 ng/ml). The C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin and N-type brain natriuretic peptide were in normal ranges. Her coagulation studies showed a prothrombin time and fibrinogen level within normal limits but mildly elevated D-dimer level (0.95 mg/L). The immunologic study was positive for antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA. Screening for antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies was negative. Endoscopic evaluation of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract with biopsies only revealed lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without any evidence of celiac disease. Her SLEDAI-2K score was 5.
A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a 6-by-13-millimeter mass of heterogeneous echocardiographic texture which was well-circumscribed, oval-shaped, protruding, sessile, and firmly attached to the atrial side of the P2 and P3 portions of the posterior mitral leaflet. The posterior mitral leaflet was diffusely thickened, predominantly at the tip and mid portions. There was no commissural fusion, calcification of the leaflets, or involvement of the subvalvular apparatus. Mild-to-moderate central mitral regurgitation and trivial pericardial effusion were present. To further elucidate the nature of the mass and rule out possible thrombi, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was subsequently performed (Figures 1E-H). The other valves were morphologically normal. Left ventricular systolic function was preserved with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 74 percent. Two-dimensional left ventricular and right ventricular global longitudinal strain values were normal.
A cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) demonstrated a preserved LVEF (60.5%) and no regional wall motion abnormalities. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images, native-T1 map, T2 map, and extracellular volume (ECV) map were normal (Figures 2C-H). Hence, lupus-induced myocarditis was excluded. The mitral valve vegetation appeared as a non-homogeneous, isodense mass involving the posterior leaflet. Transverse cine images through the right ventricular outflow tract revealed a 1.4-by-2.5-millimeter oscillating mass on the anterior cusp of the pulmonary valve which was not seen on echocardiography. Electrocardiogram-gated cardiac computed tomography (CT) with multiplanar reconstruction was subsequently performed to better delineate the exact dimensions of the vegetations (Figures 2A,B). Obstructive lesions were not found on her coronary CT angiography. CT of the abdomen and the pulmonary vasculature was negative for emboli (Figure 3A) and possible neoplasms. Deep bilateral white matter hyperintensities (WMH), which were more extensive than expected for the patient's age, were found on her brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (Figures 3B,C).
A comprehensive investigation for possible infective endocarditis (IE) including three sets of blood cultures, serologic testing for fastidious organisms, and stool sample culture did not reveal any pathogens. The final diagnosis was concomitant mitral and pulmonary valve LSE in a patient with lupus flare and protein-losing enteropathy. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone, systemic anticoagulation with subcutaneous enoxaparin, and intravenous ceftriaxone. After one month of medical therapy, the clinical and laboratory profile improved with a SLEDAI-2K score of 2. A follow-up pre-discharge 3D-TEE showed an unchanged size of the vegetation and severity of mitral regurgitation as compared to earlier echocardiographic studies.
After discharge, the patient maintained long-term therapeutic anticoagulation with acenocoumarol in addition to tapered-dose oral methylprednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil. At 3-month follow-up, she reported total remission of symptoms, and her laboratory tests demonstrated well-controlled SLE. Nonetheless, the Libman-Sacks vegetations and moderate mitral regurgitation persisted on subsequent TTEs. If our patient remains asymptomatic, repeated subsequent TTEs are planned every 1-2 years. The timeline of the patient clinical course is shown in Figure 4.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10098003/,19,images/PMC1/PMC100/PMC10098003_01
PMC9035921_01,PMC9035921,Female,41.0,"A 41-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal finding during an upper gastric endoscopic examination at an outpatient clinic. Her medical history included uterine myoma, duodenal ulcer, and hypothyroidism. Her family history indicated that her mother had thyroid, colorectal, and uterine cancer. The patient was currently undergoing thyroid hormone treatment. Her physical examination results were normal, and the laboratory data were within normal limits (data not shown). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the presence of a SMT with a delle in the greater curvature of the lower body of the stomach (Fig. 1a). On endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), the tumor had a low echo pattern and an irregular shape and was located in the submucosal layer of the stomach (Fig. 1b). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen showed that the gastric tumor was hypervascular in the arterial phase (Fig. 1c) and exhibited continuous enhancement in the post-venous phase (Fig. 1d). The tumor diameter was approximately 1 cm, and no swollen abdominal lymph nodes were observed. The preoperative diagnosis was a gastric SMT with a rich vasculature. However, because the biopsy specimen did not contain any tumor tissue, we were unable to exclude malignant tumors such as gastrointestinal storomal tumors. The patient underwent NEWS (Fig. 2a-d); the operative time was 214 min. No adverse events occurred during or after the operation, and the patient was discharged 6 days after NEWS. Macroscopic examination of the resected tumor showed that the tumor was 9 x 8 mm in size and had well-defined borders. Microscopic examination revealed a proliferation of tumor cells with spindle-shaped nuclei in the submucosa (Fig. 3a, b).
Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the tumor was positive for D2-40 (Fig. 3c) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (Fig. 3d), but negative for c-kit (Fig. 3e), discovered on gastrointestinal storomal tumors (Fig. 3f), desmin (Fig. 3g), S100 (Fig. 3h), Melan-A (Fig. 3i), signal tranducer and transactivator 6 (Fig. 3j), insulinoma-associated protein1 (Fig. 3k), CXCL13 (Fig. 3l), ETS transcription factor (Fig. 3m), follicular dendritic cell (Fig. 3n), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Fig. 3o), human melanoma black, h-caldesmon, and CD1a (Fig. 3p), 10 (Fig. 3q), 21 (Fig. 3r), 23 (Fig. 3s), 31 (Fig. 3t), 34 (Fig. 3u), 68 (Fig. 3v), and 163 (Fig. 3w). Approximately, 1-2% of the tumor cell nuclei expressed the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Fig. 3x). There was some nuclear differentiation, but no necrosis. The final diagnosis was gastric plexiform fibromyxoma. Additional treatment was not necessary, and the patient will be followed up via imaging in a year.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9035921/,4,images/PMC9/PMC903/PMC9035921_01
PMC4848433_01,PMC4848433,Female,82.0,"An 82-year-old African American female was brought to the ER after she was found lying in her bed for 3 days. At the time of presentation, she was weak and difficult to arouse. Initial history was obtained from the family. She had a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. There was no family history of renal or autoimmune disease. There was no history of preceding symptoms including rashes, arthralgia, or recent weight loss. Medications included candesartan 32 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily, atenolol 50 mg daily, and hydralazine 25 mg twice daily. Physical examination concluded significantly sunken eyes, dry mouth, and poor skin turgor but no skin rash. Cardiac exam: irregular rhythm, normal heart sounds, no additional murmurs or gallop rhythm. Respiratory: poor inspiratory effort, air entry equal on both sides. CNS: lethargy, slow speech, and intermittent confusion but no asterixis. Vital signs on admission: BP 140/60, RR 12, pulse 50, and Tmax 36.5 C. Metabolic panel on initial presentation was significant for Na 151 meq/dl, K 6.4 meq/dl, HCO3 13.2 meq/dl, blood urea nitrogen 212 mg/dl, and creatinine 19.7 mg/dl. Her baseline creatinine was later found to be 1.1 mg/dl from the outpatient blood workup six months ago. Complete blood count: WBC 5.94 cmm, Hb 9.5 g/dl, HCT 31%, and platelet count 101 cmm. Urinalysis showed +1 protein, +4 heme, and +1 ketones. On microscopic analysis, numerous red blood cells and few RBC clumps, and 0-3 white cells were seen, although no cast was seen. Urine sodium was 14meq/dl, FeNa was 1.13%, and spot protein to creatinine ratio was 465 mg/g. The renal sonogram showed the right kidney to be 11 cm and the left kidney to be 10.8 cm. Slight increase in attenuation of the kidneys was suggestive of medical renal disease. Bilateral echogenic masses were later confirmed as angiomyolipoma by CT scan. Initial management included hydration with hypotonic bicarbonate infusion followed by hemodialysis. Provisional diagnosis was ATN secondary to severe dehydration. Her mental status improved after several dialysis sessions; however, she remained oliguric and dialysis dependent. Repeat urine studies showed spot protein/creatinine ratio of 2 g. Serology for autoimmune disease was significant for an anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1:1,280 in a homogeneous pattern (n=undetectable), and mild elevation in phosphatidylserine Ig M, anti-cardiolipin IgM, and anti-histone antibodies. Anti-double stranded (anti-dsDNA), Ig G, Ig A, and C3 and C4 complement levels were within normal limits. Hepatitis B and C serology was negative. On renal biopsy, 2 out of 14 glomeruli showed crescentic necrotizing inflammation, 3 glomeruli showed cellular crescent, and global sclerosis was found in 4 out of 13 glomeruli (Fig. 1). Immunofluorescence studies showed trace staining for Ig M and C3 but no immune complex and light chain deposits. After the biopsy results, the specimen for anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) was drawn. The myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO) titer was found to be greater than 800 AI (n<=1), Proteinase-3ANCA antibody (PR3 ab) <1 and anti-histone ab was moderately positive at 2.3 U (n<=1). The final diagnosis was hydralazine-induced ANCA vasculitis with pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. After careful review of old medical records, the patient was found to be taking hydrazine for several years. After the confirmatory diagnosis, she was started on pulse dose steroids with IV methylprednisolone 250 mg TID for 3 days followed by IV cyclophosphamide 50 mg daily. Five sessions of plasmapheresis were done as part of induction therapy. However, medical therapy had to be discontinued after 1 week due to severe complications including line infection, cytomegalovirus infection, and steroid psychosis. She remained dialysis dependent and ultimately was transferred to hospice due to multi-organ failure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848433/,3,images/PMC4/PMC484/PMC4848433_01
PMC4531653_01,PMC4531653,Male,50.0,"A 50-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of sore throat, fever and bloody sputum for three months. The patient had been suffering from a recurrent sore throat for one year without seeking medical attention. On admission, he had a fever up to 39 C mainly at night, but he denied weight loss or night sweating. Physical examination showed multiple lymphadenopathy, including bilateral cervical area along the jugular chain. There was no splenomegaly or hepatomegaly. Diffuse erythematous lesions and wall thickness in the oropharyngeal area were seen on otolaryngeal examination. Laboratory findings were as follows: WBC 7,500/mm3, Hb 12.5 g/dL, Hct 37%, platelet 250,000/mm3, normal urine analysis, ALT/AST 25/40 U/L, serum alkaline phosphatase 95 IU/L and LDH 288 U/L. Chest X-ray finding was normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck showed a soft tissue mass in both oropharynx, soft palate and posterior laryngeal wall, and multiple lymph node enlargements of both cervical areas (Figure 1). For a pathologic confirmation, multiple biopsies were performed on the oropharyneal mass and other surrounding areas. Microscopic examination showed an infiltration of atypical small irregularly shaped lymphoid cells admixed with plasma cells, neutrophils and eosinophils. On immunophenotyping study, CD56 and cytoplasmic CD3 were positive and CD20 was negative (Figure 2). According to the microscopic examination and immunophenotype, a diagnosis of NK/T-cell lymphoma was made. For a staging work-up, bilateral bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, gastroscopic examination, bone scan and abdomino-pelvic CT were performed. All of these studies revealed negative findings. The final diagnosis was NK/T-cell lymphoma with stage IIB. The patient was treated initially with combination chemotherapy with COPBLAM-V (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, bleomycin, prednisolone and procarbazine). After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, a follow-up CT scan showed a partial improvement of the mass lesions in the oropharynx. However, after further two cycles of chemotherapy, he developed high fever, severe sore throat and neutropenia. Since an aggravation of the mass lesion was noted on a follow-up CT scan, salvage radiation therapy was given to the patient. Unfortunately, the radiation therapy discontinued due to a sustained neutropenia during the treatment period. The patient was referred to the Hanyang University KURI hospital for further evaluation and treatment.
On admission, the patient looked pale and sick. Physical examination revealed a newly-developed large ulcerative lesion on the hard palate. It seemed that the lesion was developed from the previous radiation therapy. The ulcerative lesion did not heal and rather, increased in size during the hospital stay. Since the new lesion was separated from the initial lymphoma site, we performed a biopsy on the ulcerating lesion of the hard palate. Unexpectedly, the biopsy revealed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with a p53 immunoreactivity (Figure 3). The ulcerated lesion was directly connected to the nasal floor. We decided to treat the patient with radiation therapy for the hard palate carcinoma. However, the patient could not tolerate the radiation therapy due to a poor general condition. Although a salvage combination chemotherapy was administered to the patient, a severe hepatic dysfunction and sustained pancytopenia developed without an improvement of the lymphoma or carcinoma lesion and he eventually died of sepsis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4531653/,3,images/PMC4/PMC453/PMC4531653_01
PMC7204884_01,PMC7204884,Female,47.0,"A 47-year-old woman with a tumor in her right breast was referred to our hospital. Both her mother and older sister had been diagnosed previously with breast cancer. She had undergone surgery twice to treat a benign thyroid tumor. During the physical examination, no mass was palpable in either breast. Ultrasonography revealed an irregular marginated hypoechoic mass measuring 15.1 x 15.0 x 9.4 mm in the 12 o'clock region of the right breast (Fig. 1a) and an irregular marginated hypoechoic mass measuring 24.8 x 21.9 x 10.6 mm in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast (Fig. 1b). Core-needle biopsies were performed at each mass site. Pathological examination of the core-needle biopsies specimen confirmed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the right mammary gland and invasive ductal carcinoma in the left mammary gland. Computed tomography scan did not reveal lymph node metastases or distant metastases (Fig. 2a). Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the primary tumor of the right mammary gland to be a mass 15 mm in size and likely to be DCIS (Fig. 2b). Contrast-enhanced MRI of the left mammary gland exhibited early phase linear enhancement (Fig. 2c). Bone scintigraphy revealed no metastasis to the bone. The preoperative diagnosis was stage 0 (cTisN0M0) right breast cancer and stage IIA (cT2N0M0, estrogen receptor [ER]-negative, progesterone receptor [PgR]-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative, with low Ki67 expression) left breast cancer. Surgery consisted of a bilateral mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy. The final diagnosis was bilateral breast cancer (right: pTisN0M0 stage 0, DCIS) (left: pT2N0M0 stage IIA, invasive ductal carcinoma, nuclear grade 1, ER-negative, PgR-negative, and HER2-negative, with low Ki67 expression). Following surgery, the patient was treated with systemic adjuvant endocrine therapy (anastrozole 1 mg/day). After 3 years of adjuvant treatment and observation, there has been no evidence of recurrence or metastasis. However, she was diagnosed with Lhermitte-Duclos disease after imaging her left cerebellar hemisphere. MRI of the brain showed alternative isointense and hyperintense bands in the left cerebellar hemisphere (Fig. 3a-c). As her sister and mother also had breast cancer, we suspected that she may have an inherited disorder.
Although phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) genetic testing was not performed, we could diagnose this patient as having Cowden syndrome using the pathognomonic criteria and major criteria of Cowden syndrome (breast cancer, thyroid tumor, and Lhermitte-Duclos disease).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7204884/,5,images/PMC7/PMC720/PMC7204884_01
PMC4189715_01,PMC4189715,Female,43.0,"A 43-year-old premenopausal woman was diagnosed in July 2006 with a locally advanced (stage IIIA, cT3 cN1 M0), hormone receptors-positive (estrogen receptor [ER] 40% of positive cells, progesterone receptor [PgR] 50% of positive cells), and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2-positive (immunohistochemistry score 3+) invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast. The Ki67/MIB-1 immunostaining was positive in 32% of cancer cells. At the time of primary diagnosis, the patient was a light smoker (less than five packs per year) with a family history of hypertension and ischemic heart disease; no other risk factors for cardiac disease were reported.
On August 2, 2006, the patient was randomized into the neoadjuvant ECTO II (European Cooperative Trial in Operable breast cancer - second) trial and she was allocated to receive exemestane 25 mg/day orally plus four cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 intravenously (iv); cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 iv at 3-week intervals (AC) followed by four cycles of paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 iv on days 1 and 8; and capecitabine 1,850 mg/m2 orally in divided doses from day 1 to 14 at 3-week intervals (TX).
The AC regimen was well tolerated, without any cardiovascular complaint.
In November 2006, during the first cycle of TX regimen, she presented at the Emergency Ward of the University Hospital of Udine, Italy, to investigate a recurrent, sharp, nonradiating retrosternal chest pain, which had started 24 hours previously. The pain lasted up to 20 minutes and was unrelated to meals and exercises, whereas it was relieved by a change of position. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature were normal. No pericardial friction rub, added heart sounds, or other abnormalities were observable through auscultation. Blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, transaminases, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum creatine phosphokinase, and creatine phosphokinase-MB fraction were all within normal limits. However, the plasma troponin I (TnI) concentration was 0.27 ng/mL (normal levels <=0.04 ng/mL) and the continuous 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter monitoring showed concave ST segment elevation in multiple leads, biphasic T wave inversion, and peaked T wave elevation (Figure 1). The ratio of ST segment elevation to T wave amplitude in lead V6 was 0.4. The electrocardiographic findings suggested the possibility of an acute pericarditis, although elevated TnI concentration was not concordant with the diagnosis.
A second cardiac evaluation was performed with a two-dimensional echocardiogram (2D Echo) that showed inferoposterior hypokinesis, with preserved global ventricular size and function; mild aortic and mitral regurgitation were also observed, with normal left atrium and absence of pericardial effusion. The final diagnosis was acute myopericarditis, and anti-inflammatory treatment with acetylsalicylic acid 800 mg twice a day for 1 month was started. The following day, white blood-cell count and serum CRP were confirmed to be normal, and plasma TnI level was 0.12 ng/mL. Two days later, a multigated acquisition scan showed normal regional kinetics, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 67%, and normal ECG tracing. However, the TX neoadjuvant treatment was interrupted and the patient was referred for breast surgery.
The patient improved soon after capecitabine discontinuation. In light of this prompt resolution, a fluoropyrimidine-induced cardiotoxicity was strongly suspected. The investigators did not perform a myocardial biopsy due to the invasive nature of this procedure.
After radical left mastectomy, a ypT2 ypN1mi, hormone receptors-positive (in this case, a semiquantitative evaluation of ER and PgR was calculated using the H-score: ER H-score 30; PgR H-score 15), HER2-positive tumor was detected, with a Ki67/MIB-1 proliferation index that resulted positive in 32% of cancer cells. Both ECG and 2D Echo showed no abnormalities, with preserved left ventricular size and function, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 64%. Therefore, the patient was offered adjuvant endocrine treatment and trastuzumab 6 mg/kg (8 mg/kg loading dose) iv every 3 weeks for 1 year. For safety reasons, trastuzumab was always infused within 90 minutes. From February 2007 to February 2008, the patient received a total of 18 trastuzumab administrations, without any cardiac complications.
Also, the patient underwent irradiation of the lymphatic drainage area, while excluding chest wall irradiation.
One year later, the patient was diagnosed with sternum and liver metastases and received first-line treatment with six cycles of docetaxel plus trastuzumab, followed by trastuzumab single agent. At disease progression, a second-line chemotherapy with lapatinib and capecitabine was planned.
Fluoropyrimidines rechallenge was attempted with reduced dose of capecitabine: 1,000 mg/m2/day, instead of 2,000 mg/m2/day, orally from day 1 to day 14 every 3 weeks. Moreover, a cardiac surveillance with daily 12-lead ECG, 24-hour ECG Holter monitoring on the 4th day of chemotherapy, and treadmill stress test on the 5th day was planned in order to detect early signs of cardiac toxicity.
On March 1, 2010, the patient received the first dose of lapatinib 1,250 mg/day continuously plus capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2/day, from day 1 to day 14, every 21 days. Five days later, during 24-hour ECG Holter monitoring, she was admitted at the Emergency Ward of a General Hospital (20 miles away from our University Hospital) due to short recurrent episodes of atypical chest and abdominal pain, associated with jugular constriction. No abnormalities were underlined with physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and 2D Echo. The plasma TnI concentration was less than 0.005 ng/mL, within the range of normality.
The Holter monitoring showed electrocardiography features consistent with Prinzmetal's angina: heart rate ranged from 45 to 137 beats/minute and transitory ischemic ECG changes, such as ST segment depression and elevation, and T wave negative inversion or peaked elevation (Figure 2A-B). Particularly, an infero-antero-lateral 4 mm ST segment elevation was observed from 7.20 am to 7.50 am, while the patient was asymptomatic (Figure 3). The patient received amlodipine 10 mg, sublingual nitrates, and acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg and was discharged 24 hours later.
In order to rule out atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and to better define the first episode of cardiotoxicity, the patient underwent coronary artery computed tomography, which showed normal arteries, and cardiac magnetic resonance, which did not show any sign of acute or previous myocarditis.
According to the strong suspicion of capecitabine-induced cardiotoxicity, the second-line treatment was changed to vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 plus trastuzumab 2 mg/kg weekly.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4189715/,1,images/PMC4/PMC418/PMC4189715_01
PMC3177592_01,PMC3177592,Male,37.0,"A 37-year-old man presented in the emergency department complaining of productive cough with blood-tinged sputum, intermittent fever, and shortness of breath for the last 20 days. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, currently unemployed, and occasionally homeless. His past medical history was remarkable only for arterial hypertension treated with atenolol.
On examination, he was ill-appearing but in no acute distress. His axillary temperature was 37.8 C, blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg with a normal heart rate of 90 bpm, and oxygen saturation SpO2: 94%. Lung auscultation revealed crackles over the lower right lung.
On laboratory testing, the patient had a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 10,900 cells/muL, with normal differential. The hemoglobin level was 10.6 g/dL, with a hematocrit of 32.5%; the platelet count was 455,000/L. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm after the first hour. A basic metabolic panel was notable for an elevated serum creatinine of 2.52 mg/dL, with urea of 57 mg/dL, and normal electrolytes. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme was slightly elevated at 57 IU/mL (normal range 8-52 IU/mL). The acute renal failure was attributed to the Serratia infection, since the patient did not previously have this disorder and Serratia is known to induce renal failure.
There was no lymphadenopathy observed in general examination, but chest x-radiography demonstrated bilateral hilar prominence, lower-right lung lobe opacification, and right hemidiaphragm elevation (Figure 1). Chest high-resolution computed tomography scan was performed according to the department's protocol for investigating the thorax. The scan revealed consolidation of the anterior segment of the right lower lobe, and bilateral paratracheal, subcarinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 2). In addition, transbronchial needle biopsy aspiration was conducted as a diagnostic approach.
Pulmonary function testing after remission of the productive cough (2 days) showed a restrictive pattern with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 49% predicted, a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 47% predicted, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 71%. The total lung capacity was 66% of predicted, and the residual volume was 79% of predicted. There was reduction of the diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide to 68% of predicted.
Serologic studies for human immunodef iciency, hepatitis B virus, and a tuberculin skin test were negative. Urine antigen for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella were given upon admission, but they were also negative.
Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed a partial extraluminal compression of the trachea without other endobronchial lesions. No evidence of inflammation, granulomas, malignancy, vasculitis, or alveolar wall necrosis were found on biopsy. The cytological results from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) showed no malignancy. The cell count on the BALF was 10.5 x 1010 cell/L, with 78% alveolar macrophages, 12% lymphocytes, and 10% neutrophils. No red blood cells or hemosiderin-laden macrophages were seen. BALF flow cytometry showed that 69% of the lymphocytes were T-lymphocytes, 7% were B-lymphocytes, and the T4/T8 ratio was 1.9, while the blood T4/T8 ratio was 1.4. Microbiology cultures of the BALF grew Serratia marcescens, which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, and amikacin. The smear for acid-fast bacilli was negative, and cultures for mycobacteria remained negative after 6 weeks.
The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. After the third day of treatment, the cough improved, and the reddish appearance of the sputum completely resolved. On follow-up after 1 month, chest x-radiography presented complete remission on right lower lobe infiltrate, while the perihilar lymphadenopathy persisted. A surgical mediastinal biopsy showed nonnecrotizing granulomas, consistent with sarcoidosis. The final diagnosis was pneumonia due to S. marcescens and stage I pulmonary sarcoidosis.
After 1-year follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic, and on chest x-radiography the infiltrate has completely resolved, while enlargement of the perihilar lymph nodes persists (Figures 3 and 4).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3177592/,4,images/PMC3/PMC317/PMC3177592_01
PMC8053471_01,PMC8053471,Female,49.0,"A 49-year-old female presented with a new-onset generalized seizure and was found to have multiple hyperdense masses with calcifications in the right hemisphere on computed tomography. A brain magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast demonstrated ten distinct dural-based, homogeneously enhancing lesions within the right hemisphere (Figure 1a-c), the largest measuring 5 x 8 cm (arrow, Figure 1c) and effacing the lateral ventricles. On examination, she was neurologically intact. Her medical history was significant for basal cell carcinoma of the face excised four years earlier. Family history was unremarkable.
She was taken to the operating room for resection of the dominant right parafalcine mass (arrow, Figure 1c) and four other (arrow, Figure 1b) lesions that were amenable to the same incision and craniotomy access. Although the tumors all displayed a mildly elevated Ki-67 index of 5-10% on histologic examination, they did not meet criteria for an atypical meningioma diagnosis and thus the final diagnosis was the WHO Grade I meningioma. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of the resected tumors and matching blood was performed and identified the presence of the same clonal somatic NF2 nonsense mutation and somatic heterozygous deletion of chromosome 22 overlapping with NF2. Germline mutations in NF2 were not found. However, a germline missense mutation in TP53 (c.542G >A, p.Arg181His) was revealed, previously described as deleterious. Subsequently, the patient was referred for formal genetic testing, which confirmed this finding, and she was diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Postoperatively, the patient underwent periodic surveillance imaging to monitor for growth of her tumors. Twenty-eight months after surgery, she underwent the second stage of resection of the progressively enlarging, although asymptomatic tumors that remained, which similarly demonstrated WHO Grade I pathology and a mildly elevated Ki-67 index of 4-6%.
WES of all tumors revealed the same somatic NF2 nonsense mutation and chromosome 22 deletions with otherwise normal copy numbers of all other chromosomes. Additional somatic mutations unique to each sample were discovered, but likely non-pathogenic as none were previously characterized as oncogenic [Supplementary Table]. Together, these findings suggested that all tumors originated from the same founding clone.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8053471/,3,images/PMC8/PMC805/PMC8053471_01
PMC3829277_01,PMC3829277,Female,51.0,"A 51-year-old woman referred to Ali-Ibn-Abitaleb hospital (Rafsanjan, Iran) with chronic cervical pain, radiating to left forearm since about 5 years ago. Pain was vague and the patient had no sensory complaint at first, but there had been recent exacerbation of pain, since 6 months ago, as sharp radiating pain and paresthesia in 4th and 5th digits of left hand.
The first clinical suspicion of physicians was cervical radiculopathy but in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) there was no disc protrusion/extrusion in cervical and upper thoracic region, and there was a mass lesion at left root of neck (Figure 1).
Despite this result the patient was treated as cervical radiculopathy with collars, NSAIDs, and gabapentin for 3 months.
With the persistence of pain and paresthesia, she came to our clinic. On the first physical examination, cervical bending was limited by pain, Spurling's maneuver was negative, and pain was aggravated by arm abduction and flexion. There was also mild atrophy of the first interdigital space. By electrodiagnostic examination, increased latency and low amplitude was detected in the left medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (about 35% of right side). Moreover, in needle electromyography there was increased insertional activity, spontaneous discharges and neurogenic motor units in first dorsal interosseous, extensor indicis, flexor carpi radialis, and left abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The brachioradialis muscle was normal. These findings were compatible with mixed brachial plexus lesion, severe in lower trunk and mild to moderate in medial cord (Table 1). In sonography of the cervical region, there was a soft tissue mass in posterior triangle with the size of 63 x 46 mm with sharp borders, and it was approved by MRI (Figure 1). 
The patient was consulted for surgical excision; open excision through anterior approach (supraclavicular) was done. The prominent bulk of tumor was located in superior mediastinum with extension to neck and serious adhesion to lower part of left brachial plexus especially lower trunk.
Pathological assessment revealed totally encapsulated neoplasm composed of spindle cells with no mitosis or necrosis. The final diagnosis was schwannoma. After tumor excision the patient had significant and immediate relief of pain and paresthesia but there was some residual numbness in medial aspect of left forearm and hand after 2 months due to neuropraxia.
Schwannomas, neurilemomas, or neurinomas are relatively rare, but benign nerve sheath tumors derive from Schwann cells with low tendency of transformation to malignancy. They are the most common neurogenic tumors and arise from any nerve surrounded by Schwann cells such as cranial, autonomic, or peripheral nerves.
Solitary schwannomas of the head and neck are uncommon tumors arising from any cranial or autonomic nerve. 25% to 45% of extracranial schwannomas occur in the head and neck. A total of 28 consecutive patients were treated between January 2000 and August 2006, for solitary schwannomas in different major nerves of the head and neck. Most affected trunks were cranial nerves in 14 patients (50%), cervical sympathetic chain in 7 (25%), and brachial plexus in 7 (25%). The most common sign was an isolated well-demarcated lesion placement at the lateral aspect of the neck for those tumors arising from vagus, lingual, and sympathetic nerves. 
Extracranial schwannomas usually present insidiously, and thus are often diagnosed incorrectly or after lengthy delays. The most common physical findings associated with brachial plexus tumors are related to local growth. Motor or sensory deficits caused by axonal loss occur more frequently with neurofibromas and malignant nerve sheath tumors. Schwannomas are usually seen as an asymptomatic neck mass, so difficulties in diagnosis are common. 
Furthermore, the cervical region is a limited space for many vascular and neural structures (such as nerve trunks, plexus, and the sympathetic chain); so any mass in this region, accompanied by sensory or motor symptoms or signs, can be a serious alarm for more investigations. In this case the chief complaint of the patient was pain and numbness in upper limb. We could not find any mass in physical examination of the neck, because the main bulk of tumor was in upper mediastinum with extension to brachial plexus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3829277/,1,images/PMC3/PMC382/PMC3829277_01
PMC6441738_01,PMC6441738,Male,4.0,"A 4-years-old boy was referred to our emergency department complained of recurrent attacks of colicky abdominal pain and non-bilious vomiting 5 times in the previous 24 h. The child had allergic rhinitis and recurrent attacks of gastroenteritis in the last four months.
Upon presentation to our hospital, the child was conscious, alert, comfortable in bed, and his vital signs were stable. Abdominal examination by inspection showed normal contour without abdominal distention and no bulging mass, with normal respiratory movement. By palpation, the abdomen was soft and lax, with no tenderness or rigidity and no palpable mass. PR examination revealed no palpable mass and an empty rectum without red currant jelly stool; the child had last defecated 12 h before.
Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a long segment small-intestinal intussusception extending from the subhepatic region through the right lumber region until the right iliac fossa region, which showed a pseudokidney appearance and no abdominal collection. Plain erect abdominal X-ray showed neither air-fluid levels nor gas under the diaphragm. Only fundic gas and a small amount of right colonic gas were observed. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was not performed due to the poor resources of our hospital.
Our decision was to perform conservative treatment with multiple ultrasonographic examinations. The conservative approach was continued for 6 h duration with nothing per mouth (NPO). He had received medical treatment in the form of IV fluid, 3rd generation cephalosporin, ampicillin/sulbactam, metronidazole and antioedematous drugs such as dexamethasone, and lasix. During this period, the child had one attack of colicky abdominal pain and non-bilious gastric vomiting. However, during this period, the child passed well-formed normal brownish coloured stool. An abdominal examination had the same results as the previous clinical examination. PR examination revealed well formed, normal brown coloured stool without any redcurrant jelly secretion. Due to the recurrent symptoms of intestinal obstruction, the senior staff made a new decision to explore the abdomen.
After the child was administrated general anaesthesia, we palpated the abdomen and felt a hemispherical mass of 4 cm x 2 cm, movable in all directions without any restriction to its movement. A supraumbilical transverse incision was performed for exploration and revealed a long segment ileo-ileal intussusception approximately 50 cm long. Milking reduction was performed easily, without any intestinal ischaemia or intestinal wall oedema. The lead point of the intussusception was a hemispherical mass, canary yellow in colour and approximately 4 cm x 2 cm. It was firm, and rubbery inconsistency, did not obstruct the lumen of the ileum and originated from the antimesenteric border of the ileum. It was located 130 cm away from the ileocaecal junction (Fig. 1). Resection and anastomosis of the ileal segment containing the mass were performed with 2 cm safety margin on each side.
A pathological macroscopic report described a polypoid submucosal fatty tumour 4 x 2 x 2 cm in size covered with intact mucosa. Microscopic examination showed a benign non-capsulated intramuscular soft tissue tumour formed of lobules of mature fat cells separated by delicate fibrovascular trabeculae (Fig. 2). The opposite small-intestinal mucosa was infiltrated by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. The final diagnosis was polypoid intramuscular lipoma of the ileum.
The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the 7th postoperative day. At 6 months following surgery, he is free of symptoms, and no evidence of recurrence has been reported.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6441738/,3,images/PMC6/PMC644/PMC6441738_01
PMC6831833_01,PMC6831833,Male,88.0,"An 88-year-old man with a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease visited our hospital complaining of progressive dry cough, dyspnea, fever, and chills. He had been prescribed Sai-rei-to 25 days before admission, and these symptoms developed two weeks after initiating Sai-rei-to therapy. He was an ex-smoker (Brinkman index: 800), had taken no medication except for Sai-rei-to, and had no history of any pulmonary disease and allergy.
The body temperature was 38.0  C, and percutaneous oxygen saturation was 99% on 12 L/minute reservoir mask oxygen. The respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, blood pressure was 189/91 mmHg, and heart rate was 72 bpm. On chest auscultation, bilateral late inspiratory crackles were detected. He also had bilateral pretibial edema. Laboratory test results showed that the white blood cell count was 8000/mm3, with 78.8% neutrophils and 7.8% eosinophils, and platelet count was 155,000/mm3. The brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated to 406 pg/mL, and serum C-reactive protein level was 10.51 mg/dL.
Sialylated carbohydrate antigen Krebs von den Lungen-6 level was 374 U/mL, and surfactant protein-D level was 339 ng/mL. Blood coagulation test findings were within the normal range. Bacteriological tests did not detect any bacterial or viral pathogens. Serum complement fixation test value for Mycoplasma pneumoniae was elevated fourfold. The indices of serum IgM, IgA, and IgG for Chlamydia pneumoniae were 0.565, 1.706, and 1.590, respectively. These single sample serum data did not reach the reference value required for a positive result. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe hypoxemia. Echocardiographic examination showed that the ejection fraction was 60% and wall motion was almost normal.
Chest radiography showed ground-glass opacities in both lung fields (Fig. 1). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) demonstrated bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities, infiltrative shadows, and pleural fluid (Fig. 1). Nasal high-flow (NHF) oxygen therapy was initiated because of severe hypoxemia. Bronchofiberscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, with an elevated neutrophil proportion (total cell count 325,000/mL, with 26% lymphocytes, 62% neutrophils, and 12% macrophages; the CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.49).
The patient's clinical course is shown in Fig. 2. Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) caused by Sai-rei-to was the most likely diagnosis, because he had no history of interstitial pneumonia or collagen disease, and he had started taking Sai-rei-to a month earlier. However, we could not exclude heart failure and community-acquired pneumonia. Therefore, all his ongoing oral therapies, including Sai-rei-to, were stopped and steroid pulse therapy (1000 mg/day of methylprednisolone [mPSL] for three days), furosemide, and combination antibiotic therapy, with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, were initiated from the day of admission.
On the 4th hospital day, he required oxygen therapy (FiO2 0.65 on NHF) despite the administration of steroid pulse, diuretic, and antibiotic therapies. As his BAL findings suggested alveolar hemorrhage, we considered an alternative diagnosis of Goodpasture syndrome or ANCA related vasculitis. Therefore, we initiated TPE treatment (fresh frozen plasma; 3000 mL/day) and CyA (CyA; 180 mg/day) on that day. TPE was performed thrice in 5 days, and FiO2 decreased from 0.65 to 0.30 during this period.
However, on the 10th hospital day, his respiratory condition had worsened; FiO2 had again increased from 0.30 to 0.35, and the bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities and infiltrative shadows on HRCT had worsened (Fig. 3). On the same day, we again conducted BAL. The diffuse alveolar hemorrhage persisted, and the differential white blood cell count was still neutrophil-predominant (total cell count 50,000/mL, with 29% lymphocytes, 42% neutrophils, and 25% macrophages).
IVIG therapy (25 g/day) was introduced from the 11th hospital day for five days because we could not exclude that alveolar hemorrhage was due to potential vasculitis. After initiating IVIG therapy, his respiratory function and the bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities and infiltrative shadows on HRCT began to improve (Fig. 3); he was therefore switched from NHF to nasal cannula two days after starting IVIG therapy. After the IVIG therapy, the dosage of mPSL and CyA could be decreased gradually from the 19th hospital day and the 23rd hospital day, respectively. Further, tests for anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, myeloperoxidase-ANCA, and proteinase 3-ANCA yielded negative results. No other clinical findings supporting the diagnosis of vasculitis were detected.
On the 45th hospital day, he was discharged after the introduction of home oxygen therapy (HOT). The changes observed in the interstitial shadows on HRCT are shown in Fig. 3. CyA was discontinued from about one month after discharge because his renal function deteriorated. One and a half year after discharge, HOT was withdrawn. About two years after discharge, mPSL was discontinued. Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test conducted about half a year after the withdrawal of mPSL demonstrated a positive result for Sai-rei-to (stimulation index = 384%). Thus, the final diagnosis was DLI due to Sai-rei-to. The patient has remained well throughout the follow-up period.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6831833/,2,images/PMC6/PMC683/PMC6831833_01
PMC10207330_01,PMC10207330,Female,34.0,"A 34-year-old woman presented to our hospital with concerns of an abdominal mass with dull pain for several days. Physical examination found a palpable mass measuring 5-6 cm in diameter in the lower abdomen. Computed tomography revealed a multinodular mass measuring 7.6 cm x 4.1 cm x 6.5 cm located in the rectus abdominis muscle with multifocal calcification and uneven enhancement. Serum tumor markers such as CA125 (Cancer Antigen 125), SCC (Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen), and CA19-9 (Cancer Antigen 19-9) were all in the normal range. She had a history of ""broad ligament leiomyosarcoma"" 8 years prior and was treated with radical resection in our hospital. Because recurrence was suspected, she underwent a second surgery for abdominal mass excision. A tough and irregular mass was found beneath the lower abdominal wall during the operation. The mass invaded the subcutaneous fat layer and penetrated through the rectus abdominis muscle. No other intraoperative abnormities were found.
Grossly, the tumor had a multinodular appearance in the abdominal muscles below the superficial fascia and intruded into the extraperitoneal adipose tissue. Nodules measuring from 4 to 9 cm were found isolated from each other. All nodules were irregular in shape, with sharp margins and well-demarcated outlines. The cut surfaces were all cartilage-like with a brittle texture, gray to gray-white color and focal calcification (Figure 1).
Microscopically, the vast majority of the neoplasm was composed of well-differentiated cartilaginous islands arranged in lobules (Figure 2A). The boundaries were generally smooth. The chondrocytes were uniform in shape with mild to moderate atypia and were unevenly distributed in the cartilage matrix (Figures 2B, C). Aside from the cartilage islands, a single cluster of spindle cells was observed (Figure 2D). The spindle cells were arranged in bundles and featured cigar-shaped nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm (Figure 2E). The spindle cells were positive for ER (Estrogen Receptor), PR (Progesterone Receptor), Caldesmon and Desmin, indicating an origin of smooth muscle cells from the genital tract. The strong positivity of P53 in chondrocytes indicated that cartilage islands, although well differentiated, were malignant (Figure 2).
To clarify the relationship between recurrent and primary tumors, we reviewed the histomorphology of the former surgical specimen. The primary tumor was composed of two types of cells: spindle cells and epithelioid cells. Sarcomatoid-like spindle cells were arranged in the fasciculus or vortex with cigar-shaped nuclei and sparse eosinophilic cytoplasm under high magnification (Figure 3A). Epithelioid cells with round to ovoid nuclei and prominent nucleoli arranged in cords or small nests were embedded in the edematous and mucinous matrix (Figure 3B). Marked necrosis could be easily observed under low-power microscopy (Figure 3C). The tumor cells showed overall mild to moderate atypia with active mitosis demonstrating over 10/10 HPF (Figures 3D, E). Such morphological characteristics met the standard for a diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. It is worth mentioning that no heterologous component was discovered after thorough evaluation.
The final diagnosis was leiomyosarcoma with epithelioid differentiation. The patient then received 4 cycles of APDTIC (EPB, DTIC, DDP) chemotherapy after radical surgery.
The immunoprofiles of primary and recurrent tumor were listed in Table 1. As shown below, tumor cells in both lesions were positive for Vimentin, ER, PR, Caldesmon, SMA (Smooth Muscle Actin), Desmin, and negative for P-CK (pan Cytokeratin). P16 was found patchy in both lesions. The Ki67 index was approximately 25% in the primary neoplasm. Although it was only 2% in the recurrent neoplasm, the increased expression of P53 indicated malignant biological behavior of the recurrent tumor.
Taking into account both the overall medical history and the histopathological characteristics, the abdominal lesion was confirmed to be leiomyosarcoma with chondrosarcoma differentiation. The patient was in good condition after 6 cycles of combined chemotherapy (pharmorubicin, cis-platinum and dacarbazine).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10207330/,6,images/PMC1/PMC102/PMC10207330_01

The patient had a 20-pack year history of smoking and moderate alcohol intake. Initial ENT evaluation with direct laryngoscopy showed some fullness in the right base of the tongue without any abnormality at the larynx or pyriform fossa. CT scan of neck demonstrated a 3.8-cm necrotic mass in the right neck. Ultrasound guided biopsy of the right neck mass was consistent with malignant cells favoring poorly differentiated SCC. Patient was referred to our center for further work up. Repeat direct laryngoscopy showed a suspicious lesion at the right aryepiglottic fold. He underwent CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis plus PET-CT, which showed a right neck mass (4.2 cm x 3.5 cm) medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A diagnosis of metastatic SCC of the right cervical lymph node with likely primary lesion at the base of the tongue or larynx was made.
Patient underwent right supra-glottis CO2 laser laryngectomy and right modified radical neck dissection in September 2009. Pathology from the right supra-glottis laryngectomy showed 0.6 cm tumor, which was consistent with moderately to poorly differentiated SCC with clear margins. Right neck dissection showed 3 out of 21 lymph nodes positive for metastatic SCC with the largest being 3 cm in greatest dimension. There was an extra-nodal extension of the tumor. The final diagnosis was T1N2bM0 (Stage IVA) right supra-glottis laryngeal SCC. Patient received adjuvant treatment with chemoradiotherapy completed in January 2010. Two months after completion of adjuvant treatment, the fiber-optic laryngoscopy and CT scan of neck showed no evidence of disease.
In October 2010, patient developed dysphagia, and examination of esophagogastroduodenoscopy and showed a stricture at 31 cm, a friable mass at 31-34 cm, Barrett's mucosa noted from 34 to 39 cm, and the diaphragm at 39 cm from the incisors, respectively. Endoscopic ultrasound was done but the scope could not be passed through the stricture, but showed a mass at about 24 cm from the incisors in the paraesophageal area just below the aortic arch. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the esophageal stricture and mediastinal mass showed poorly differentiated SCC, positive for p63 and CK 5/6 by immunohistochemical study. Imaging study with PET-CT and CT scan of neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis confirmed locally advanced esophageal cancer with mediastinal lymph node involvement. He underwent chemoradiotherapy with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin, completed in February 2011. A follow-up CT scan of chest in June 2011 indicated a good treatment response with tumor shrinkage. He declined surgery after completion of chemoradiotherapy.
In November 2011, he developed blood streaked bowel movement and severe anemia with hemoglobin of 5.9 g/dL. He underwent CT scan of abdomen and pelvis and colonoscopy, and was found to have a 3-cm mass in the proximal ascending colon (Fig. 1). The biopsy showed metastatic SCC (Fig. 2). Immunohistochemical study showed the tumor was strongly positive for CK 5/6, with foci of weak staining for p63 and negative staining for CK20 or CDX2, which was most consistent with a metastatic lesion rather than a primary colorectal carcinoma. He subsequently received palliative radiation (3000 cGy) to the ascending colon cancer with improvement of anemia, and remained transfusion independent for more than 3 months. In January 2012, he also received palliative radiation for brain metastasis. He was offered palliative chemotherapy but he refused. He entered hospice in May 2012, and passed away shortly afterwards.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5395791/,2,images/PMC5/PMC539/PMC5395791_01

He denied cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, hematochezia, melena, headache, and dizziness. The past medical history was significant for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with stent placement in 2007, coronary artery disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral artery disease with percutaneous intervention in 2007. On presentation he was afebrile at 36.6  C, had a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 77/43 mmHg, and SpO2 of 97 %. His blood pressure improved to 130/60 mmHg after fluid resuscitation. Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia. His physical exam was otherwise benign aside from a scabbed 4 cm scratch in the right groin with surrounding ecchymoses that was caused by one of the patient's dogs. Laboratory studies were significant for a white blood cell count of 14.86 x 109/L, BUN of 40 mg/dL, and creatinine elevated at 2.16 mg/dL from baseline of 0.8 mg/dL (Table 1), consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI). Blood cultures were drawn at this time.
The patient was evaluated for fever and leukocytosis, and a chest x-ray was ordered in the ED which showed patchy bilateral basilar opacities. Though the patient did not have any respiratory symptoms or pertinent exam findings, he was diagnosed with suspected community acquired pneumonia. He was admitted for management of pneumonia, AKI, and poor oral intake. On hospital day two, a lumbar spine x-ray showed no acute pathologic findings; no further evaluation was performed. After receiving fluids, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, his renal function and neurologic status improved to baseline. Thus, he was discharged on hospital day two with instructions to complete a course of outpatient antibiotics (cefdinir 300 mg twice a day for four additional days). Blood cultures remained negative on discharge.
He returned to the emergency department two days after discharge for worsening right-sided back pain that made it difficult to ambulate. At presentation, he was afebrile, had a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 173/80, and SpO2 of 96 %. Physical exam was only significant for mild tenderness to palpation of the R paraspinal area. Labs were significant for white blood cell count of 17.25 x 109/L (Table 1). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed a ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The patient was started on an esmolol drip, and subsequently transferred to our tertiary referral center.
Emergently after transfer, the patient underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm for rupture utilizing a Medtronic aortoiliac device. Post-operatively, he was placed on piperacillin-tazobactam due to leukocytosis with unknown etiology of aortitis. The vascular surgery team reported inflammatory findings suspicious for infectious aortitis during his procedure. White blood cell count began trending down. At this time, five days after obtaining blood cultures during the patient's first admission, a gram-negative rod was identified. Nine days after obtaining blood cultures, the anaerobic culture ultimately grew Capnocytophaga species, with no available susceptibility data. Repeat blood cultures were obtained and remained negative, though the patient had received antibiotics prior to these. The final diagnosis was infectious aortitis due to Capnocytophaga leading to aneurysm rupture, as a result of the patient's dog scratches.
Patient had a PICC line placed and was discharged on 6 weeks of IV ceftriaxone 2 g daily, to be given via outpatient infusion. Following a 6-week course of IV ceftriaxone, he was placed on long-term antibiotic suppression with amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg twice a day due to placement of endovascular prosthetic material during aortic repair. To date, this patient has had no further complications from his illness course, operation, or treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10127112/,1,images/PMC1/PMC101/PMC10127112_01
PMC5659828_01,PMC5659828,Male,58.0,"In December 2013, a 58-year-old man with a history of type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) and dyslipidemia was referred to our centre, the Hospital de Clinicas de Sao Paulo, a large academic and public centre located in Sao Paulo, Brazil, from the primary care service to investigate uncontrolled blood pressure and blood glucose. At initial clinical examination, he presented facial phletora, hirsutism, violaceous striae and centripetal obesity, and a CS clinical diagnosis was suspected. Initial examinations identified hypercortisolism and elevation of ACTH (Table 1). The ACTH increment in the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test was 14%, suggesting an ectopic ACTH-producing tumour. To confirm this hypothesis, the patient underwent an inferior petrosal sinus sampling with CRH stimulation. The central/peripheral ACTH gradient was less than 2 at 0, 3, 5 and 10 min after desmopressin injection, confirming the ectopic ACTH producing. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the abdomen showed an expansive lesion in the tail of the pancreas measuring 5.0 cm in the largest diameter, multiple small nodules in hepatic segment III and increased volume of both adrenals (Figure 1). In January 2014, he was referred to our institution, the Instituto do Cancer do Estado de Sao Paulo, where he underwent an R0 body-caudal pancreatectomy, splenectomy and removal of the segment III of the liver, which was compatible with PNET, infiltrating the liver tissue. The final diagnosis was of a well-differentiated PNET, with positive immunohistochemistry staining of synaptophysin and chromogranin A, three mitosis/10 high-power fields and Ki67 index of 6%. There was adequate clinical control of DM2 and SAH after resection. In July 2014, a Gallium-68-DOTATATE PET-CT was performed and did not show any measurable metastatic disease. However, in November 2014, he presented hyperglycaemia and high blood pressure again, associated with elevation of both serum cortisol and ACTH, which were resultant from hepatic recurrence with a new lesion of 1.2 cm in segment VI of the liver. Because the patient was quite sick to undergo new hepatic resection due to uncontrolled CS and also because of the short interval from last metastasectomy, new surgical resection was contraindicated. Octreotide LAR 20 mg IM once every 28 days was started but was unsuccessful in controlling symptoms. Subsequent hepatic embolisation did not improve his condition either. Due to uncontrolled CS in February 2015, bilateral adrenalectomy was performed and the CS finally resolved. The pathology report revealed a metastatic neuroendocrine tumour in the left adrenal, with immunohistochemistry staining positive for synaptophysin, chromogranin A positive and ACTH, negative staining for CD56, CDX2 and TTF1 negative and ki67 index of 30%.
After symptom control, the patient was lost to follow up, returning six months with recurrent hyperglycaemia and skin hyperpigmentation; at that time, the elevation of plasma ACTH was identified. A new MRI of the abdomen showed a progression of hepatic metastases. Octreotide LAR was tried again, but there was disease progression after two doses. In October 2015, he received the combination of oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 given on day one and capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 (CapOx) orally for 14 days, in a 21-days cycle. At this time, he presented diffuse exuberant hyperpigmented lesions of the skin, mainly in interphalangeal joints and tongue (Figure 2). After two cycles, there was significant improvement in cutaneous hyperpigmentation and the patient was restaged with new CT scans that showed stable disease. Despite good tolerance, the patient requested to stop chemotherapy and he went on chemoholiday. In March 2016, after three months without treatment, the hyperpigmented lesions of the skin worsened and imaging tests evidenced new progression of liver disease. Re-exposure to CapOx was indicated. He received three more cycles, when in in April/2016, CT scans demonstrated partial response in liver lesions. The patient chose to pause the chemotherapy once again. At the last image evaluation, in June 2017, the tumour has remained stabilised and three has been no further worsening of skin hyperpigmentation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5659828/,3,images/PMC5/PMC565/PMC5659828_01
PMC10435880_02,PMC10435880,Male,71.0,"A 71-year-old man had a history of obesity (100 kg), with essential hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, right knee total arthroplasty, and bilateral total hip arthroplasty. He underwent total left knee arthroplasty, with early post-operative infection caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Streptococcus agalactiae, and Finegoldia magna. Despite two iterative debridement surgeries and adequate antibiotic therapy for 6 months, the outcome was not favorable, and he showed clinical symptoms of relapsing left knee infection 1 month after antibiotic discontinuation. He had left knee dermohypodermitis, and there was a purulent discharge through a fistula in direct continuity with the prosthetic articulation. He received 10 days of ceftobiprole, which successfully cured dermohypodermitis. He then underwent the first surgery of a two-stage left knee arthroplasty replacement strategy (see pre-operative photography and post-operative X-ray in Figure 2). The implant was removed, soft tissues were debrided, and a non-articulated spacer was molded with gentamicin- and vancomycin-loaded polymethylmethacrylate cement (COPAL  G+V). An anterolateral thigh flap was performed. Empiric post-operative antibiotherapy was daptomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. Definitive antibiotic therapy with co-trimoxazole and rifampicin was started upon finding only MSSA in all pre-operative sample cultures at day 15.
Unfortunately, he developed necrosis on the distal portion of his flap, prompting him to perform a new surgery 1 month after the previous one. Soft tissues were debrided, and an intra-articular collection was evacuated; multiple samples were collected. The spacer was removed, and a new one was implanted (COPAL  G+V with manual addition at the time of spacer preparation of 2 g of fosfomycin). A new flap and a split-thickness skin graft were performed. Post-operative empiric antibiotherapy was piperacillin-tazobactam and daptomycin. An NDM and OXA-48-producing Enterobacter cloacae strain was cultured in all samples. It was resistant to meropenem, levofloxacin, and co-trimoxazole. It had intermediate susceptibility to tigecycline (MIC: 1.5 mg/L). It was susceptible to colistin (MIC: 1 mg/L), fosfomycin (MIC:12 mg/L), and amikacin. Moreover, it was resistant to ATM and CAZ-AVI (MIC > 256 mg/L) but susceptible to ATM + CAZ-AVI (CMI: 0.19 mg/L). The final diagnosis was a carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae-associated spacer super-infection. Definitive antibiotherapy was ATM (continuous infusion of 3 g in 150 ml of NaCl 0.09% per 12 h, twice a day), CAZ-AVI (continuous infusion of 3 g/0.75 g in 150 ml of NaCl 0.09% per 12 h, twice a day) as a continuous infusion using elastomeric infusor, colistin (4 MUI per 8 h), and daptomycin (850 mg per day).
After 2 weeks of colistin, the patient developed acute kidney injury with elevated eosinophils on blood test analyses. Immunoallergic interstitial nephritis associated with colistin was evocated: colistin was discontinued, and the patient received systemic corticosteroids. Renal function and eosinophil count improved shortly thereafter. ATM and CAZ plasmatic concentrations were monitored, and dosages were adapted accordingly to reach a steady-state concentration of at least four times the minimal inhibitor concentration (steady-state concentrations were 13.7 mg/ml and 85 mg/ml, respectively). No adverse event associated with ATM and CAZ was reported.
ATM, CAZ-AVI, and daptomycin were continued for 12 weeks. The patient underwent another surgery after 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment: the spacer was changed again (COPAL  G+V). Further outcomes were favorable, and all antibiotics were discontinued at 12 weeks.
Unfortunately, upon the total knee arthroplasty reimplantation surgery performed after 3 months, pre-operative findings were evocative of persistent chronic infection, and microbiologic samples were positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis. Iterative surgery was required 1 month later because of unfavorable local outcomes and found evidence of Candida parapsilosis super-infection. There was no other occurrence of carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae-associated infection. Infection control was obtained after adequate antibiotic treatment, and a suspensive antimicrobial treatment with doxycycline and fluconazole was decided. Further outcomes were favorable at 24 months after the last surgery: no pain was reported, the patient could walk although there was a limitation in flexion angle, and there was no radiologic evidence of persistent chronic infection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10435880/,7,images/PMC1/PMC104/PMC10435880_02
PMC4655780_01,PMC4655780,Female,7.0,"A 7-year-old spayed female Labrador Retriever presenting left forelimb lameness for one day was admitted to the Veterinary Hospital (UNESP-Botucatu) for clinical evaluation. The animal had a clinical history of recurrent lameness and intermittent reluctance to move over a period of one year.
The initial treatment included tramadol (4 mg/Kg TID), firocoxib (5 mg/Kg SID) and clavulanic acid plus amoxicilin (25 mg/Kg BID).
Blood analysis revealed an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (381.49 IU/L; reference range [RR] = 45-233 IU/L), alkaline phosphatase (263.6 UI/L; [RR] = 20.00-156.00 UI/L), total serum protein (10.8 g/dL; [RR] = 5.40-7.10 g/dL), total plasmatic protein (8.2 g/dL; [RR] = 6-8 g/dL), globulin (7.50 g/dL; [RR] = 2.70-4.40 g/dL), CK (63.4 UI/L; [RR] = 1.15-28.40 UI/L) and calcium (16.0 mg/dL; [RR] = 9.00-11.30 mg/dL).
Hemogram revealed mild anemia (5.0 x 106/microL; [RR] = 5.50-8.50 x 106/microL), PCV (33%; [RR] = 37-55%), increased MHC (40%; [RR] = 32-36%), leukocytosis (18.1/microL; [RR] = 6.00-17.00/microL) with neutrophilia (15390/microL; [RR] = 3000-11500/microL), mild lymphopenia (900/microL; [RR] = 1000-4800/microL) and monocytosis (1800/microL; [RR] = 150-1350/microL).
Radiography revealed an osteoproliferative and osteolytic lesion in the metaphysis of the left humerus (Figure 1).
Periosteal samples of the affected limb were obtained by ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration for cytopathologic evaluation. The collected material was spread on histological slides, air-dried, methanol fixed and Giemsa stained.
Smears showed high cellularity with degenerate and non-degenerate neutrophils in a 3:1 ratio, fewer histiocytes and abundant cellular debris on an acidophilic background.
Rare osteoblasts, sometimes associated with a slight pink and amorphous material (bone matrix) were observed as well. No infectious agents were seen. Initial diagnosis was suppurative periostitis.
Three days after, the animal was submitted to bone biopsy and bone marrow aspiration in order to acquire a more representative sample. The bone marrow aspiration was submitted to the agarose cell block technique, bacteriological and fungal culture.
The bone biopsy was fixated in 10% formalin and routinely processed. The samples for cell block of agarose were packed in an Eppendorf tubes, 70% ethanol fixed, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed and 2% liquid agarose was added. Then, the samples were re-centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to obtain a solid pellet. Finally, the pellet was paraffin embedded, processed for histopathological evaluation and stained with hematoxilin and eosin (H&E) (Figure 2) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain (Figure 3).
Bone biopsy presented moderate thinning of the bone matrix with diffuse distribution associated with the moderate amount of osteocytes, discrete presence of osteoblasts and rare osteoclasts, which established a final diagnosis of osteoporosis.
Cell block samples presented similar cytopathological previously described findings in addition to several PAS positive, hyaline, septate and regular hyphae with parallel walls and 45o branching angle, compatible with Aspergillus spp.
Microbiological culture yielded negative results. The final diagnosis was suppurative and mycotic osteomyelitis due to Aspergillus spp.

PMC7755876_01,PMC7755876,Female,40.0,"A 40-year-old woman had been diagnosed with ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma thirteen years ago and had undergone hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, lymphadenectomy, and additional chemotherapy for twelve cycles. The patient had no regular reexaminations and found no discomfort after the procedures. Seven years ago, the patient presented with a mass in the left breast that was localized, palpable and painless. The serum cancer antigen 125 level reached 87 U/mL. The patient had no familial history of breast cancer. Ultrasound (US) (4 MHz, Mylab 90, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) findings showed an oval cystic mass measuring 8*6*7 cm3 in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. The mass was anechoic with an uneven wall thickness (Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (3.0 T, Signa HDx, GE, Connecticut, USA) findings showed a lobulated cystic mass measuring 7*6*6 cm3 located in the left breast. The mass showed a slightly high signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) (3.0 T; TR 400 ms, TE 7 ms, flip angle 90 ), slightly high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) (3.0 T; TR 2800 ms, TE 108 ms, flip angle 90 ) and low signal intensity on short time inversion recovery (STIR) imaging (3.0T; TR 7800 ms, TE 52 ms, IT 175 ms, flip angle 90 ). The cystic wall and septum of the mass were unevenly thick and showed slight and localized enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) (3.0T; TR 4 ms, TE 2 ms, flip angle 14 , Gd-DTPA 0.1 mmol/kg) (Figure 1B-E). Unfortunately, the patient had not undergone mammographic (MM) examination. Histological examination after lumpectomy showed an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT-1) and negative for gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15) (Figure 1F-G). The final diagnosis was metastasis of ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma to breast. The patient then received a combination chemotherapy of carboplatin (700 mg on day 1 of a 30-day cycle) and paclitaxel (210 mg/m2 on day 1 of a 30-day cycle), which was initiated 35 days after the surgery.

He also had a 1-month history of an enlarging and non-painful breast lump (Fig. 1). He did not have fever, night sweats, cough or breathlessness. He denied trauma or contact with tuberculosis. Physical examination revealed a firm and elastic mass in the internal quadrants of the left breast with well-defined contours, about 6 cm in diameter. Local temperature was normal and the overlying skin and nipple were intact. There was no evident neck or axillary palpable adenopathy. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count within normal limits, haemoglobin of 12.1 g/dl and C-reactive protein of 5.42 mg/dl; all other blood chemistry results were within normal limits. Radiography showed no obvious lesions (Fig. 2). Mammary ultrasound revealed in the inner quadrants of the left breast a thick-walled cystic formation measuring 69x20 mm, with detritus in the region of greatest slope. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of a white fluid revealed a necrotic background with granulomas without neoplastic cells. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and acid-fast bacilli stain of the aspirate were both positive for tuberculosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed a liquid collection in the left anterior thoracic wall, measuring 31x80 mm, associated with irregularity and discontinuity of the 4th left costal cartilage, with a fistulous tract that crossed the cartilage into a small locus posterior to the left internal mammary artery; in the upper left lobe there was a cavitated nodule measuring 22 mm, compatible with an active tuberculous process (Figs. 3 and 4). Positron emission tomography (PET) showed a possible nodule in the left upper lobe and bilateral mediastinum-hilar adenopathy, with increased uptake of FDG-F18 (Fig. 5).
Peripheral uptake of FDG-F18 was noted as well in a hypodense mass in the left anterior thoracic wall. An interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) was positive and HIV serology was negative. A sputum smear was positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) which was also positive by Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Sputum culture was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex that was sensitive to all tested drugs. The final diagnosis was pulmonary tuberculosis (PT) with a tuberculous mass in the left anterior chest wall, as a result of direct extension from underlying pleural and pulmonary disease.
Quadruple therapy with anti-tuberculosis drugs was started: isoniazid (300 mg), rifampicin (450 mg), ethambutol (800 mg) and pyrazinamide (1500 mg).

There was no nipple discharge, or fever. No history of breast trauma, hormone replacement therapy, or family history of breast cancer. On physical examination, large palpable mass is identified within the left breast with regular borders. The nipple, areola, and skin are unremarkable. There was no palpable lymph node in the left axilla. The right breast and axilla were normal and systemic examination did not show any abnormality. Investigations showed normal complete blood count, and chemistry apart from raised serum glucose level. Liver function test is within normal limits. Chest x-ray is grossly unremarkable.
On her mammograms, large oval and dense mass is identified within upper outer quadrant of the left breast (Figure 1, Figure 2). The mass is multilobulated and well circumscribed in its contours. It measures about 9.2x7.5 cm. There were no associated microcalcifications. The nipple-areola and skin complex are grossly unremarkable. No significant enlarged axillary lymph nodes are seen. The right breast is within normal limits. Our impression based on the mammograms is unusual large dense mass of the left breast coded as BIRAD 4A taking into consideration the patient age for further evaluation by target ultrasound. The differential diagnosis would include phyllodes tumor, PASH (Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia), and well circumscribed carcinoma.
Ultrasound was performed in same sitting for further characterization using Philips IU22 ultrasound machine. The ultrasound revealed a large heterogeneous and lobulated mass seen in the left breast upper outer quadrant corresponding to the mammographic density. Few internal anechoic cysts are seen at the peripheral aspect of the lesion. Doppler interrogated images were also obtained which revealed no internal vascularity within the mass (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5). There were no associated enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Plan was made for histological confirmation by biopsy. The procedure risks and benefits were completely explained to the patient. Procedure consent form was obtained from the patient. Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy was performed. The specimen was sent to the pathology department for analysis. The procedure was uneventful. No complications were reported.

PMC5173512_01,PMC5173512,Male,40.0,"A 40-year-old man who had been treated for recurrent oral candidiasis came to our hospital because of general malaise and progressive body weight loss, losing 10 kg in a half year. He was bisexual, having no habit of intravenous drug use. While he had no history of any sexually transmitted diseases, he had experienced herpes zoster 5 years before, but he had never taken any human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody tests.
At presentation, he had low grade fever, gum bleeding and tinglingness in the posterior cervical region. He complained of no particular respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Physical examination revealed oral candidiasis, gingivitis and slight lymphadenopathy involving the cervical, submandibular, left postauricular and inguinal nodes (measuring 4-5 mm in diameter, without tenderness). The liver and spleen were not palpable. Folliculitis was seen on the trunk and extremities. An HIV screening test was positive and a Western blot test was done, and it proved to be positive. Blood examination results were as follows (Table 1); HIV-RNA 1,400,000 copies/mL, CD4 count 10/muL, slight pancytopenia, and hypergloburinemia were seen. The serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level were slightly elevated. With an extremely low CD4 count and wasting syndrome, he was diagnosed as having AIDS. Therefore, a thorough examination regarding opportunistic infections and sexually transmitted diseases was done. Plasma (1->3) beta-D-glucan, cytomegalovirus antigenemia, HBs-antigen, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, and Treponema pallidum latex agglutination test, and rapid plasma reagin test were negative. Blood, fecal, sputum, and urine cultures were done, but no particular microbes including bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and protozoa were detected. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed slight splenomegaly and lymph node swelling in the neck areas. Lymphadenopathy was not detected in the thorax or abdomen. No lung lesions were found in a CT scan. Brain MRI, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and total colonoscopy showed no abnormalities. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was not suspected, and sulfamethoxazole 800 mg/trimethoprim 160 mg was administered as PCP prophylaxis. Oral azithromycin 1,200 mg weekly was also started as prophylaxis for the MAC infection. At that time, no respiratory symptoms were observed, and mycobacterium was not detected in a smear. However, after four weeks of incubation mycobacterium was detected in a sputum culture, but polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for M. tuberculosis and MAC were negative.
After the completion of fluconazole therapy for oral candidiasis, cART was started with abacavir, lamivudine and darunavir/ritonavir. On day 11 (of cART), fever, tender submental lymph node swelling and trismus developed. On day 18, his temperature rose to 40 C and cervical lymph node (LN) swelling became more conspicuous with severe tenderness (Fig. 1). The serum ALP level was 618 U/L and MAC-IRS was suspected. On day 28, we performed a biopsy of the submental lymph node. At this time, the CD4 count was 94/muL and the serum HIV-RNA level had declined to 1,700 copies/mL.
The sampled lymph node had swollen to 2 cm in diameter and the surface of section was gray-white with focal yellowish area. Histologically, non-caseous granuloma was seen (Fig. 2a), and relatively thin bacilli were detected in Ziehl-Neelsen staining (Fig. 2b). Mycobacterium was isolated after 8.8 days in supplemented Middlebrook 7H9 broth liquid culture (BacT/ALERT(R) MP for mycobacterium, Biomerieux, USA) and after 11 days in 7H11 agar culture. In 2% Ogawa egg slant medium (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial, Tokyo, Japan), it was scotochromogenic with an intense yellow color in both light and dark conditions (Fig. 3). Therefore, the strain was thought to belong to the Runyon II group. DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH Mycobacteria(R) Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial) was done, but there were no matches with any of the 18 mycobacterial species.
To identify this isolate, sequence analyses were performed, targeting fragments of the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA, 269 bp), RNA polymerase B (rpoB, 315 bp), and heat shock protein 65 (hsp65, 401 bp) genes. In a 16S rRNA sequence, although this isolate best matched with M. simiae with 99.7% homology, it also matched several reference strains with more than 98.5% homology (M. lentiflavum, M. triplex, M. genavense, M. intermedium, M. scrofulaceum, M. kansasii and M. gastri). The sequence analysis showed a high homology rate with Mycobacterium sp. UN-152, (GeneBank accession no. AB547401) reported as M. shigaense; 100% in 16S rRNA, 100% in rpoB, and 94% in hsp65. This strain was thus identified to be M. shigaense. Later the strain was proven to grow at 25 C, 30 C and 37 C, but not at 42 C. A niacin test was negative. Table 2 shows the results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests (BrothMIC NTM(R); Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial). Clarithromycin, ethanbutol and rifabutin seemed to be moderately susceptible, while the others were not susceptible.
An antimycobacterial regimen was started on day 25 of cART. The regimen contained rifabutin (RBT) 150 mg, ethanbutol (EB) 750 mg, and clarithromycin (CAM) 800 mg. Isoniazid (INH) 300 mg was also added until the subspecies was identified.
Soon after initiation of the regimens, the fever subsided, but lymph node enlargement continued. A subcutaneous abscess with a protruding erythematous lesion appeared on the sternum and grew to 5 cm in diameter within a week (Fig. 4). Drainage was performed, and again, mycobacterium was found in Ziehl-Neelsen stain, and it was later identified to be M. shigaense. Thus, the final diagnosis was immune reconstitution syndrome caused by the novel mycobacterium, M. shigaense. Though we could find mycobacterium in the biopsy or drainage specimens, it took over 4 months to correctly identify this strain. Meanwhile, INH was continued.
The serum ALP level normalized at 12 weeks, HIV-RNA turned to negative at 16 weeks, and the CD4 count recovered to over 100/muL at 27 weeks after the initiation of cART (Fig. 5). Blood, urine and stool cultures for Mycobacterial were repeatedly done, but those were all negative. The skin lesions and lymphadenopathy all gradually improved, and the antimycobacterial regimen was stopped after 6 months. Since then, the patient has been followed up without any recurrence of NTM disease for more than a year.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5173512/,8,images/PMC5/PMC517/PMC5173512_01

She was admitted to the psychiatric unit for further assessment and management and was started on olanzapine for agitation and disturbing delusions. The electroencephalogram (EEG), CT head, and pertinent blood work were unremarkable. She was screened for cognitive impairment with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and scored 19/30. She was discharged home after a one-week stay at the psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder associated with psychosis. She was seen in our memory clinic 2 months after discharge with a rapidly progressive cognitive and functional decline. She was dependent on most activities of daily living, such as bathing, grooming, and dressing, and became socially withdrawn with reports of prosopagnosia in the last several months. Her neuropsychological testing assessment showed severe impairment in memory, attention, executive function, language, and visuospatial domains. She scored 7/30 on Mini-Mental State Examination. Her neurological examination remained unremarkable, except for motor apraxia. She underwent extensive workup for rapidly progressive dementia.
Laboratory tests performed at this time included paraneoplastic profile, serum, and urine heavy metals, infectious processes such as HIV, syphilis, and Lyme disease, which were found to be negative; however, she had both elevated antithyroid peroxidase (TPO-Ab) and antithyroglobulin (TG-Ab) antibodies indicative of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. An MRI of the brain with volumetric studies was performed. The MRI showed asymmetric (right>left) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal hyperintensities in the cortical ribbon of the parietal, frontal, and temporal lobes, hippocampi, caudate, and putamen (Figures 1A,B). There were no signal abnormalities in the perirolandic gyri, occipital cortex, thalami, and cerebellum. This pattern was highly suggestive of CJD. Volumetric studies showed mainly right-sided frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes atrophy. Hippocampal and medial temporal lobe volumes were within normal limits.
At her follow-up visit 2 weeks later, the husband reported the patient developed intermittent jerking movements in her extremities. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture and repeat EEG. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed no RBCs, elevated 14-3-3 protein, elevated t-tau protein levels of 6,858 pg/ml (normal range <1,149), amyloid-beta 42 level of 185.85 pg/ml (normal range >1,026 pg/ml) and p-tau of 59.55 pg/ml (normal <54 pg/ml). The t-tau/p-tau ratio was 115. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was also elevated at 62 ng/ml (normal range <15). Repeat EEG did not show periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs). A real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) test was negative. On her follow-up visit she had developed new symptoms; a resting tremor of the right hand, biceps tendon hyperreflexia, inappropriate laughter, urine and stool incontinence, and began eating nonfood items. Two months from her initial memory consultation visit, her exam was significant for myoclonic jerks and evolving mutism, highly suspicious for probable CJD. She also received 3 courses of high-dose steroid therapy followed by a tapering dose of prednisone for the possibility of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. The patient failed to elicit any improvement in steroid treatment, continued to decline, and was transitioned to hospice care. The patient's decline continued, requiring total care. She became bedbound and the patient expired 20 months after the CJD diagnosis, and her brain was sent to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) for autopsy. The illness duration from symptom onset (neuropsychiatric symptoms) to death was 32 months (Figure 2). The long duration of the symptoms is consistent with the typically prolonged survival of VV1.
The autopsy included histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis, western blot, and genetic testing. Western blot findings demonstrated PK-resistant PrPD type 1, with the unglycosylated PrPD isoform migrating to ~ 20 kDa (data not shown), and histopathological features of the VV1 subtype (Figure 3). Genetic analyses did not detect pathogenic mutations of the prion protein gene (PRNP) and the patient was valine homozygous at codon 129 (129VV). The final diagnosis was sporadic CJD of the VV1 subtype.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9124891/,4,images/PMC9/PMC912/PMC9124891_01
PMC3855097_01,PMC3855097,Female,60.0,"We describe the clinical history of an obese 60-year-old woman, married with 3 children, who previously underwent an endonasal transsphenoidal resection for an intrasellar nonfunctioning presumptive pituitary macroadenoma invading the left cavernous sinus. At the first clinical observation, the patient presented with frontotemporal stabbing pain, insomnia, left diplopia, and convergent strabismus. After neurosurgery, the pathology study showed that the mass could be classified as atypical pituitary adenoma ACTH-, GH-, PRL-, TSH-, FSH-, chromogranin A-, with light cytoplasmatic positivity for pan-cytokeratin, LCA-, Vimentin+, S100-, EMA-, CD34-, CD1a-, p53+(10%), ki67+(30%).
One month after resection, the patient was readmitted to our clinic for headache associated with pain unresponsive to indomethacin. The patient showed left eye lachrymation, photophobia, nausea, diplopia, and signs of paresis of the IV pair of cranial nerve. She underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sella turcica with 1.5T superconductive units before and after an intravenous injection of contrast medium (0.1 mmol/kg of body weight). MRI showed the tumor regrowth in the original sellar location with a haemorrhagic component involving the left cavernous sinus and encasing the internal carotid artery (Fig. 1). A new transsphenoidal resection was performed with a near complete resection of the sellar mass. The pathology examination identified a neoplastic fibrous stroma tissue infiltrated by a population of pleomorphic cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei concluding as presumptive atypical pituitary adenoma. After 2 months, she again presented headache, abnormal right-directional gazing, diplopia in all directions of gaze, and exophthalmos. The MRI showed a large and dishomogeneus sellar mass with lateral, inferior, and anterior extension involving the cavernous sinus, the sphenoidal bone with sinus invasion, the left orbital apex with orbital fissures, and the optic canal (Fig. 2). The patient underwent 3 months of stereotactic radiotherapy (17 Gy to the periphery and 34 Gy to the center of the residual tumor). A few months later, because of a worsening of the general clinical situation, dyspnea, and asthenia, a contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan of the whole body revealed several metastases involving the pulmonary parenchyma bilaterally (Fig. 3). The patient underwent a thoracoscopic atypical lung resection. All the surgical specimens including the sellar and lung tissue neoplasm were reviewed by a referent neuropathological centre. The final diagnosis was secondary lung localization of AT/RT with primary pituitary localization. Therefore, systemic antineoplastic therapy was started with doxorubicin (DOXO) and vinorelbine (VNL) (DOXO 37.5 mg/mq gg 1-2; VNL 30 mg/mq gg 1-8). After 9 cycles, the total body CECT control demonstrated a mild progression of the sellar mass and stability of the lung metastasis. Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) was then performed on the residual sellar mass. As a complication of SRT, the patient showed cerebrospinal fluid fistulas treated surgically. After treatment, the patient underwent an additional CECT, which showed a progression of the disease. A CT of the head revealed a huge invasive sellar and extra sellar mass that eroded the sphenoid bone, with invasion of the ethmoid and erosion of the anterior cranial fossa. A large component of the mass occupied the nasopharinx (Fig. 4); a progression of the lung localization was also observed. A therapy consisting in carboplatin AUC 5/taxolo 175 mg/mq every 21 days was started. During the second cycle, the clinical condition of the patient deteriorated. She presented with hyposthenia and paraesthesia of the upper and lower limbs, hearing impairment, reduction of visual acuity, nose bleeding, and dyspnea. Unfortunately, 30 months after the first neurosurgical treatment, she died.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3855097/,4,images/PMC3/PMC385/PMC3855097_01
PMC4344966_01,PMC4344966,Female,44.0,"A 44-year old female patient presented with a clinical history of breast cosmetic augmentation surgery by saline-filled silicone implant, about 14 years ago. She had recently experienced pain, tenderness, breast enlargement and discomfort associated with rather firm indurations around the implant of the right breast, radiating into the right arm, for few months. There was history of radiation of pain into the right arm.
The Sonography was non-diagnostic because of the presence of breast implant. On systemic examination, neither lymphadenopathy nor hepatosplenomegaly were detected. There was no evidence of cutaneous involvement. Imaging studies also ruled out the possibility of any systemic disease.
During the operation, large amounts of unusual fibrinous material were found around the saline-filled breast implant, mainly located in the lower inner quadrant LIQ. Then the suspicious tissues were biopsied and submitted for histological examination. The necrotic debris and surrounding tissue were fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Representative sections of the whole specimen were embedded in paraffin blocks, processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for routine histological examination; also serial sections for immunohistochemical studies were prepared. Immunohistochemical staining was as performed by using antibodies, summarized in Table 1.
Under light microscopy, sections revealed predominance of necrosis intermingled with particles of neoplastic tissue of lymphoid origin, composed of many large anaplastic lymphoid cells with large lobulated nuclei, showing rather irregular nuclear membrane and one or more prominent basophilic nucleoli. The cytoplasm was slightly basophilic with prominent Golgi region. Mitotic figures were frequent. There were also many histiocytes, containing abundant pale cytoplasms. Some sections included portions of a dense fibrous capsule, associated with diffuse marked infiltration of eosinophils.
The anaplastic cells exhibited positive immunoreactions for leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CD3, CD30 (Figure 1A) and granzyme B (Figure 1B). However, they were negative for AlK (Figure 1C), epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, CD 5, CD 7 and CD20. The final diagnosis was ALK-negative ALCL (Figure 2A-C).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4344966/,1,images/PMC4/PMC434/PMC4344966_01
PMC9238200_01,PMC9238200,Female,62.0,"A 62-year-old female underwent right partial nephrectomy 2 years earlier. Postoperative pathological diagnosis revealed stage I RCC, clear cell type. Also, she underwent endoscopic submucosal resection due to early gastric cancer 7 years ago. Preoperative Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan using a single portal venous phase was obtained in the initial assessment of RCC 2 years ago. It revealed a well-defined, slightly high density mass, about 70 Hounsfield unit (HU), size 1.7 cm x 1.4 cm, in the lower pole of kidney. The radiological findings diagnosed the lesion as benign such as hemorrhagic renal cyst. During routine follow-up assessment, an enhanced CT scan showed a slightly increase in the size of the slightly high attenuating mass, 60 HU, approximate measuring 2.1 cm x 1.7 cm. The mass demonstrated partly exophytic growth and equivocal peripheral enhancing septa (Fig. 1A). Moreover, there was no fat-density lesion or enhancing solid component in the mass. On MRI, the lesion correlating with CT image appeared as a well-defined tumor with dependent hemorrhagic component. Relative to the normal renal cortex, the nondependent portion showed intermediate signal intensity on axial T2-weighted image and T1-weighted image (Fig. 1B, C). On dynamic contrast-enhanced scan, the mass showed a few minimally thickened enhancing septa, about 3 mm in thickness in the peripheral portion (Fig. 1D, E). There was no metastasis or lymph node enlargement. Our initial differential diagnosis included renal tumor with hemorrhage such as RCC, complicated renal cyst with hemorrhage. The patient underwent partial nephrectomy due to history of RCC in contralateral kidney. Invasion of the surrounding tissue was not observed. Grossly, the mass was a 2.3 cm sized, well-demarcated multilocular cystic mass filled with serous and hemorrhagic fluid. Microscopic examination revealed that the mass was composed by variable sized cysts without expansile growth. The cysts were lined by single layer of tumor cells with abundant clear or granular cytoplasm with low grade nuclei (WHO/ISUP grade 2). The final diagnosis was confirmed to be MCRNLMP (Fig. 1F). The patient has been regulatory followed up for 1 year without recurrence or metastasis.

PMC8168801_02,PMC8168801,Female,20.0,"A 20-year-old female from Ethiopia presented with a giant skull-based tumor with a massive orbitocranial deformity distorting her facial anatomy and right eye.
Diagnostic angiography, CT, and MRI revealed a giant, moderately hypervascular, multilobulated, and peripherally calcified expansile mass lesion which appeared to arise from the skull base and occupy the entire nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, and ethmoid sinus regions [Figure 3]. The intracranial extension of the tumor obliterated the sella turcica, bilaterally invaded the cavernous sinuses, and caused extensive elevation and splaying of the internal carotid arteries, anterior cerebral arteries, optic chiasm, and intracranial optic nerves. The mass measured approximately 10 cm x 8 cm x 11 cm. There was no evidence of edema or gliotic reaction in the adjacent brain parenchyma.
The patient underwent resection of the tumor through a subcranial transfacial approach. A bicoronal incision was carried down, preserving the galeal layer for possible use as a graft later. An incision was made over the face and nose to expose the front of the tumor. We broke through the thin bony shell and entered the multiloculated cystic tumor cavity. Fluid was drained and the operating microscope was brought into the field. This allowed us to work circumferentially to remove the entire solid tumor components all the way back to the circumferential bony shell. This left a massive cavity measuring over 15 cm in diameter. All soft tissues were removed and bone was drilled down. The lateral wall of the tumor was drilled, allowing for replacement of the globe to a more natural position. Bone was also drilled off the medial wall to decompress the lesion. The dura was never entered. Calvarial bone grafts were harvested by taking a large frontal parasagittal craniotomy.
A craniofacial reconstructive surgeon with the help of an oculoplastic specialist completed a complex reconstruction. We used the bone grafts to reconstruct a new orbit and mid-face. Repair of the skull bone and scalp was undertaken in a second surgery by our craniofacial/plastic surgeon.
Histopathological examination demonstrated an ossifying fibroma with a proliferation of plump spindle cells, mostly hypocellular, with focal hypercellular areas. Production of woven bone was seen intermittently with the spindle cells. The spindle cells showed focal areas of storiform arrangement with focal osteoblastic rimming. The final diagnosis was fibrous dysplasia.
The patient remained neurologically and physically stable throughout the follow-up period, with the exception of increasing headaches and occasional nosebleeds. Follow-up PET and MRI at 1 month and 10 months postoperative were stable and showed no evidence of tumor growth. The patient has been followed for 10 years with mild interval progression of bony changes but no clear evidence of tumor regrowth. During this time, she underwent one additional delayed cosmetic procedure for her left eye.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8168801/,2,images/PMC8/PMC816/PMC8168801_02
PMC2627182_01,PMC2627182,Female,37.0,"A 37-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of exertional dyspnea, cough and one recent episode of hemoptysis. At the time of admission, she showed no hypertension or systemic symptoms. A chest radiograph showed a left hilar mass with a lobulated margin (Fig. 1A). The axial and coronal CT scans were obtained with using 16-channel multidetector CT after IV administration of contrast media. A mildly enhancing left hilar mass with an endobronchial protrusion and an extension along the left lingular segmental bronchus was noted (Figs. 1B, C). The lung setting image showed localized emphysema distal to the endobronchial lesion (Fig. 1D).
Bronchoscopy revealed a mutilobular, hypervasacular mass obstructing the lumen of the left lingular segmental bronchus (Fig. 1E). A careful biopsy was taken from the peripheral portion because the tumor tended to bleed. This tumor was believed to be either an endobronchial bronchogenic carcinoma or another type of hypervascular tumor. The pathologic diagnosis was chronic inflammation with granulation tissue, which was not in accordance with the radiologic findings.
We subsequently performed a left upper sleeve lobectomy with dissection of the mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient suffered no hypertensive crisis during or after surgery. The gross examination showed an endobronchially growing solid mass along the bronchial lumen, the so-called toothpaste figure, and this mass measured 7x3 cm in dimension. The remaining lung parenchyma showed no remarkable change (Fig. 1F). The mass showed a yellowish brown granular appearance with infiltration into the bronchial wall. The microscopic examination revealed that the tumor consisted of nests of epitheloid cells in an organoid or alveolar pattern, and this was surrounded by a delicate, richly vascular reticulin network, producing the classic 'zellballen' or basket pattern (Fig. 1G). The tumor cells showed marked nuclear pleomorphism and up to one or two mitotic figures/10 high power fields. There were associated microscopic necrotic foci. Immunohistochemical staining for chromogranin, which is a marker for neuroendocrine tumors, was strongly positive. There was no metastasis observed in the dissected lymph nodes.
After surgery, a CT evaluation of the neck and abdomen demonstrated no abnormal findings. The biochemical study revealed the following: the urine epinephrine level was 2.3 microg/day (0-20 for the normal range), and the norepinephrine level was 37.3 microg/day (15-80 for the normal range). The final diagnosis was a primary pulmonary paraganglioma with malignant potential.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627182/,7,images/PMC2/PMC262/PMC2627182_01
PMC8077481_01,PMC8077481,Male,58.0,"A 58-year-old man presented with transfixing abdominal pain on July 17, 2019. A corporeo-caudal lesion of the pancreas, containing the celiac trunk and associated with secondary hepatic lesions, was discovered in July 2019. The patient had no symptoms, signs, or findings prior to the abdominal pain that prompted presentation. Upon hospital admission, the patient underwent a physical examination by an oncologist. Regarding the personal history of past illnesses, the patient had undergone surgery and radiation therapy for a testicular seminoma in 2007.
Laboratory testing was performed and showed that plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme level was elevated (17.3 ng/mL; normal: <5.2 ng/mL) and the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level was exceedingly elevated (7,329 IU/mL; normal: <27 IU/mL). Liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and ruled out the possible recurrence of testicular seminoma. No deleterious mutations were identified in the tumor tissue for the breast cancer 1/2 (BRCA 1/2) genes.
Computed tomography (CT) scan showed secondary hepatic lesions and peritoneal carcinomatosis. The final diagnosis was corporeo-caudal lesion of the pancreas, containing the celiac trunk and associated with secondary hepatic lesions.
Figure 1 illustrates the treatment timeline.
The patient received modified FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil 1,200 mg/m2 continuously for 46 h, levofolinate 200 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, irinotecan 150 mg/m2) as first-line chemotherapy. After six cycles, in November 2019, the CT scan revealed an increase in pre-existing liver lesions as well as the appearance of new liver lesions and lesions of peritoneal carcinomatosis, indicating disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. An incidental pulmonary embolism was also discovered.
Second-line treatment (1,250 mg/m2) was administered on days 1 and 8, and repeated on day 21, adapted to the patient's general condition. After three cycles of treatment, the disease was deemed stable, according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria (i.e., a 16% decrease in target hepatic and pancreatic lesions). However, during the fourth cycle of gemcitabine (Gemzar ; Eli Lilly), three periumbilical indurated nodules appeared, two of which were erythematous (Fig. 2A). During the fifth cycle of gemcitabine, these nodules remained visible and slightly increased in size (Fig. 2B). After six cycles, skin infiltration and abdominal pain associated with peritoneal carcinomatosis increased. The umbilical orifice showed unfolding of the umbilicus (Fig. 2C). Reassessment by CT scan also showed disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1), both hepatic and peritoneal.
Third-line treatment with FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m2 and then 1,200 mg/m2 administered continuously for 46 h, irinotecan 180 mg/m2) was started on April 15, 2020. Under FOLFIRI, there was clinical progression of the periumbilical lesions (Fig. 3); in particular, greater induration and subcutaneous infiltration occurred, which were responsible for increased pain.

She is a 70-year-old woman who worked as a childcare worker and is now retired. She used to drink 30 g alcohol/day until 10 years ago and she still smokes 5 cigarettes/day. She was diagnosed with depressive syndrome 10 years ago. Currently, she is on Trazodone 100 mg/day and Clonazepam 0.5 mg/day. There are cases of PD (brothers) and depression (mother and maternal grandmother) among her family records.
She first visited neurology clinics 10 years ago with memory loss complaints. On that occasion, cognitive screening tests, blood tests, and CT scan were normal. Complaints were supposed to be in relation with a mood disorder, and no treatment was prescribed. She came again 5 years ago due to impairment of memory. She also complained about unbalanced gait, intentional tremor, and difficulty doing fine tasks. Caregivers referred social, behavioral changes, and personal care difficulties, even when she was still living on her own at that time.
Neurological examination showed hypomimia, mild rigidity in the four limbs, global bradykinesia, and unbalanced gait. There was a mild and mixed (rest and action) tremor affecting the four limbs. Her Mini-Mental Status Examination reflected deficits in memory, while her performance on the Frontal Assessment Battery was notable for impairment in inhibiting automatic responses, verbal fluency, and Trail making tests A & B. She also demonstrated deficits in the memory and verbal fluency sections of the Seven Minute Screen.
Laboratory tests were all normal. Baseline MRI showed mild diffuse atrophy of the cerebrum together with some small vessel lesions affecting periventricular and semioval white matter. Follow-up MRI (5 years later) showed more intense atrophy in the left frontal and temporal lobes (Figure 1A). Tc-99m-HMPAO SPECT showed bilateral but asymmetric hypoperfusion (more on the left side) on frontotemporal lobes (Figure 1B). 18F-FDG-PET showed mild to severe hypometabolism on the left frontotemporal lobe junction, and mild hypometabolism on the left fronto-basal left anterior cingulum regions (Figure 1C). DaTSPECT was informed as for the normal density of presynaptic dopaminergic uptakers (Figure 1D). Some irregularities in the morphology of basal ganglia and increase of cortical uptake were present.

On examination the patient was in good condition. The right breast was slightly increased in volume. We found a 5 cm lump involving all quadrants of the breast with no cutaneous involvement. Ganglionic area and axilla were free. The sonography showed a hypo echoic (Doppler vascularized) nodular formation with fuzzy limits. The mammography revealed a homogeneous opacity, dense, with poorly defined contours, on the two internal quadrants with a retromammelonal contingent (labelled ACR-3). The trucut biopsy was in favour of a lactating tubular adenoma. The radioclinic discordance, the morphological aspect and the exiguous nature of the material, an immunohistochemical complement was requested. An absence of pancytokeratin labelling contrasted with strong expression of CD31, CD34 (endothelial markers) is described. The proliferation index (Ki67) was estimated at 30%. This led to the conclusion that the phenotypic aspect is related to a vascular proliferation that evokes an angiosarcoma. After a multidisciplinary reassessment, the patient benefited from a conservative treatment by an enlarged excision of the tumour (Fig. 1). The histopathological examination of the surgical specimen found an infiltrating mesenchymal proliferation made of vessels of variable sizes anastomosed to vascular slits with lesional limits (Fig. 2). The endothelial cells were often spindle shaped, with anisocaryotic nuclei and numerous mitoses and reduced cytoplasm (Fig. 3). The immunohistochemical examination on the surgical specimen showed to the same phenotypic profile on biopsy (Fig. 4).

The patient has no medical history other than COVID-19. The CT scan showed a cystic necrotic component that caused suspicion of adrenocortical carcinoma or pheochromocytoma. The patient was evaluated for excess hormone production with the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test, serum and urine metanephrines, plasma renin activity, and serum aldosterone. There was no excess hormone production by the adrenal mass. Several imaging studies, in addition to computed tomography scans, were performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a semisolid mass with cystic and necrotic components and peripheral diffusion restriction, which increased suspicion of adrenocortical carcinoma (Figures 1A,B). Therefore, the patient underwent 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). In this imaging study, an enhancement of FDG at the level of malignancy was seen, and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was 9.94 (Figure 2). Due to heterogeneous imaging findings, to exclude silent pheochromocytoma or any metastasis of pheochromocytoma, the patient also underwent metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy; however, there was no enhancement throughout body.
Owing to the suspicious findings in the imaging studies, surgical excision was planned. Because of the small mass size, laparoscopic transabdominal adrenalectomy was applied. During gross examination of the excised material, two components were easily seen (Figure 3). One cystic component with suspected mass and unaffected adrenal gland. After the operation, the patient had nothing remarkable and was discharged postoperative on the third day. Postoperative follow-up was continued until 8 months, and there was no recurrence or any complaints after surgery.
At the end of the pathological examination, the final diagnosis was consistent with adrenal schwannoma.

PMC4727093_01,PMC4727093,Female,42.0,"A 42-year-old woman presented to the Department of Radiology of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China) with continuous pain in her right hip and occasional pain in her left leg, in addition to dizziness and heart palpitations. The patient had been experiencing these symptoms during the two months prior to the date of admission to the hospital in June 2010.
The results of a blood routine test performed prior to the date of admission suggested anemia, and the patient had been receiving treatment for anemia during one month at her local hospital, but the pain in her right hip worsened. Therefore, the patient was referred to the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Physical examination identified a firm mass with a poorly delineated margin that was palpable in the right hip. The left leg examinations did not indicate any abnormalities. The red blood cell count was 2.23x1012 cells/l, and the levels of hemoglobin were 66.20 g/l. The patients initial pelvic radiograph revealed a large right proximal femur osteolytic process with cortical disruption (Fig. 1). Computed tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of a large non-matrix producing soft tissue lesion in the right proximal femur, which was accompanied of cortical destruction, but did not exhibit surrounding sclerosis or associated periosteal reaction (Fig. 2).
Following tumor resection, the patient received bone cement and was subjected to internal fixation. Microscopic examination of the tumor specimen by hematoxylin and eosin stain (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) revealed proliferation of large polygonal cells separated by thin fibrous septa. The cells presented round nuclei, were disposed centrally, and contained abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. A small number of normal mitoses were also observed (Fig. 3). On immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were diffusely positive for myoglobin and cytokeratin, focally positive for Ki-67, and negative for cluster of differentiation (CD)138, CD79a, CD20, CD3, CD30, anaplastic lymphoma kinase and chromogranin A (CgA). Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with ASPS of the right proximal femur.
The patient initiated chemotherapy treatment with adriamycin (A) and ifosfamide (I) at 20 days post-surgery. The AI protocol consisted of 4-day administration of ifosfamide at a dose of 3 g/m2, and 3-day administration of adriamycin at a dose of 60 mg/m2. In addition, the patient received adequate mesna for protection and hydration. The treatment was effective in treating the symptoms, and the patient achieved IV degree of bone marrow suppression. The second round of chemotherapy started three weeks later, and following four weeks, the patient accepted radiotherapy with total doses of 60 Gy/200 cGy/30 fraction/40 day. During this period, the patient complained of persistent pain in the left leg.
The subsequent X-ray examination was normal (Fig. 4), but plain CT scan revealed a focus of marrow replacement, surrounded by a soft tissue mass without cortical bone destruction (Fig. 5). The soft tissue mass displayed homogeneous texture, sharp margins and mild enhancement surrounding the right femoral cava, while the marrow replacement exhibited heterogeneous enhancement upon administration of contrast medium (Fig. 6). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a clearer lesion extent of marrow replacement, which presented equal signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging and bright signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging. The surrounding soft tissue mass displayed the same signal intensity (Fig. 7).
According to the clinical manifestations and radiological features, second primary tumor of bone rather than metastatic tumor was hypothesized. Following limb salvage treatment, microscopic examination of the specimen revealed that the tumor cells aligned diffusely with remarkable heteromorphism (Fig 8), and the adjacent striated muscles were invaded. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated the tumor to be leukocyte common antigen+, CD99+, vimentin-, desmin-, melanoma-, synaptophysin-, pancytokeratin-, CgA-, CD3-, CD43+, CD20- and CD79a-. The pathological diagnosis was established to be peripheral T-cell lymphoma with the invasion of adjacent striated muscles.
According to the clinical manifestation and pathological results, the final diagnosis was ASPS of the right femur and PLB of the left femur. The patient then received radiotherapy, and was followed up for 4 years. To date, there is no evidence of bone marrow aspiration or abnormal laboratory results.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4727093/,13,images/PMC4/PMC472/PMC4727093_01
PMC7607988_01,PMC7607988,Male,61.0,"A 61-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with chief complaints of fever with rash all over the body and loss of appetite (for 1 week), dark-colored stools, and urine (for 3 days) and shortness of breath. The patient had anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Peripheral smear showed signs of hemolytic anemia (anisopoikilocytosis, spherocytes, and polychromasia), and lactate dehydrogenase was raised. Urine findings showed the presence of hemoglobin and bilirubin. Treating physician advised high-resolution computed tomography chest that revealed multiple lymphadenopathy with mild bilateral pleural effusion.
Initial differential diagnosis included lymphoma and infectious mononucleosis (IM) with AIHA. Lymphoma was ruled out on excision biopsy of cervical lymph node. Meanwhile, the patient hemoglobin dropped further and bone marrow biopsy revealed lymphocytosis, and tests for anti- Epstein-Barr virus antibodies were positive. Physician suspected PCH and, therefore, patients' samples were sent to laboratory for direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and indirect antiglobulin test (IAT). While IAT was negative, DAT was positive. Additional test with monospecific antiglobulin reagent exhibited anti-C3d antibody. The thermal amplitude of autoantibodies ranged from 4 C to 22 C. Negative CD55 and CD59 markers ruled out paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
In view of clinical history and positive DAT with C3d specificity, treating physician and laboratory physician discussed and decided to perform DL test. DL test was positive, confirming PCH [Figure 1]. The final diagnosis was, therefore, IM with PCH though P specificity of autoantibody could not be confirmed.
The patient was managed with antiviral (acyclovir), steroids (prednisolone), and RBC transfusion (one unit). The patient recovered completely and was discharged after 7 days on tapering doses of prednisolone. The patient is doing fine after 1-month follow-up with complete disease remission and normal laboratory parameters.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607988/,1,images/PMC7/PMC760/PMC7607988_01
PMC7529156_01,PMC7529156,Male,35.0,"Our patient, a 35-year-old right-handed male, a soldier by occupation and a resident of Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India, presented with the complaints of fever for the past 2 weeks and altered sensorium for the past 4 days following an episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure. There was no associated upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, no burning micturation, ear discharge, rashes, or other skin lesions or head trauma. His investigations showed that he was HIV-1 reactive. He had a history of prolonged fever for 1 month a year back and had been diagnosed with tubercular lymphadenitis by the fine-needle aspiration study. He was prescribed rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the same, and he was continuing to take all of them till date. There was no history of addictions. He was married for 7 years and had two children. Examination revealed normal vitals in a conscious but disoriented patient with a staring look and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 11/15. General examination revealed pallor and oral thrush. Neurological examination revealed a Folstein's Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 12/30 with no signs of meningismus. Due to the condition of the patient, whatever restricted examination of motor system, sensory system, and cranial nerves was possible was normal. Examination of cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and musculoskeletal system was within normal limits.
Investigations revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 33 mm (1st h) and a mild normocytic normochromic anemia (hemoglobin - 10.4 g%). Other biochemical parameters (liver function, kidney function, and blood sugar) were normal. Urine examination was also normal. A repeat testing of HIV by the ELISA confirmed the presence of antibodies against HIV-1. The CD4 count was 156/mm3, with a CD4 percentage of 14%. The differential diagnosis includes HIV with the likelihood of CNS opportunistic infections or HIV encephalopathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination reveals 10 cells, all mononuclear, with a sugar of 56 mg%, and a protein of 46 mg%. The adenosine deaminase levels were found to be 10 IU/L (within normal limits), and the CSF did not show any organism on Gram stain or Ziehl-Neelsen stain. The India ink staining for Cryptococcus was also negative. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in CSF was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, human herpesvirus-6/herpes simpex virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Cytomegalovirus. The PCR for JC virus could not be carried out due to financial constraints. Serum Widal, venereal disease research laboratory, hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C RNA, and IgG antibodies against toxoplasma were all negative.
Imaging of the brain revealed bilaterally symmetrical, T2/FLAIR hyperintensities noted in the white matter, involving the bilateral centrum semiovale, periventricular, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and midbrain (cerebral peduncle) suggestive of encephalitis on magnetic resonance imaging [Figure 1].
The patient's attendant did not give consent for a brain biopsy. The final diagnosis was made to be HIVE in a treatment-naive patients with a CD4 count of 156/mm3 with oral candidiasis.
He was started on antiretroviral therapy with triple-drug regimens of tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz along with antieplieptics and fluconazole. After 3 months of follow-up, he was seizure free, and his MMSE revealed marked improvement (from 12/30 to 20/30).

PMC4644016_01,PMC4644016,Male,25.0,"A 25-year-old male patient presented in the emergency room with a history of an acute onset of a severe upper abdominal pain radiating to the back and vomiting following binge alcohol intake. On clinical evaluation there was tenderness in the epigastrium and the left hypochondrium. There was no h/o fever, hematemesis, jaundice, constipation, previous surgery or similar episodes in the past.
Clinically provisional diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was kept. Routine blood investigations along with serum lipase were done which revealed mildly elevated lipase levels, i.e. 300 U/L (normal range, 80-140 U/L).
X-ray of the chest and abdomen (Figure 1) was carried out which did not give any diagnostic clue. USG of the abdomen was performed which revealed multiple coarse calcifications in the pancreatic head (body and tail was obscured) with intra-abdominal fat stranding. The spleen was not visualised in the splenic fossa with mild collection in the left anterior para-renal space. The rest of the solid organs were normal. No visualisation of the spleen was viewed with great suspicion but no reason could be found behind it (except that the spleen could be atrophic or obscured by bowel gases). Even patient's symptoms could not be related to it.
On the basis of a clinical, laboratory and ultrasound correlation, the patient was managed conservatively for 3 days considering the most likely diagnosis of acute or chronic pancreatitis. As the symptoms worsened, clinical and ultrasound diagnosis was challenged and the patient was advised to undergo MDCT of the abdomen for further evaluation.
Abdominal MDCT was carried out and revealed atrophic pancreas with calcifications in tail region Figure 2), well-defined organized collection in the sub-capsular location indenting the superior pole of the left kidney (Figure 3) with extensive fat stranding in the perinephric space and peripancreatic region. The spleen was not visualized in the splenic fossa. However, the splenic artery was noted arising from the celiac trunk coursing along the tail of the pancreas up to a soft tissue density structure in relation to the posterior wall of the stomach measuring approximately 3.3x3x4 cm (Figure 4). The splenic vein was visualized only near the portal vein formation. The soft tissue density lesion showed moderate enhancement surrounded by non-enhancing collection and a rim of air foci. It was protruding within the lumen of the stomach (Figures 5, 6). The surrounding stomach wall appeared thickened and oedematous with perigastric fat stranding. A soft-tissue structure protruding within the stomach lumen was the spleen as the splenic artery could be traced up to it with the tail of the pancreas in relation to it. The most striking imaging finding in this case which later led us to the final diagnosis was destruction of the splenic parenchyma with protrusion of the remaining tissue into the stomach lumen.
The hypothesis behind this was a cascade of events which started with gastric perforation, spillage of highly destructive gastric juice over the stomach bed and finally becoming silent with rapid sealing of the defect by the omentum and the spleen.
The spleen was destroyed by continuous contact with gastric contents; however, perforation was diagnosed before it could give away. So the diagnosis of gastric perforation sealed by the spleen was kept.
The patient was operated on emergency basis with the following intra-operative findings - a) large rent along the greater curvature which was sealed by a soft-tissue structure and omentum b) bulky oedematous mesentery with collection in the right paracolic gutter.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4644016/,6,images/PMC4/PMC464/PMC4644016_01
PMC6296199_01,PMC6296199,Male,62.0,"This study was approved by the ethics committee of Peking University First Hospital. Written informed consent has been provided by the patient to have the case details and any accompanying images published. A 62-year-old male patient presented to the local hospital with a 1-month history of epigastric pain, abdominal distension, and reduced bowel movement. He denied any fever or drenching night sweats. Abdominopelvic CT scan revealed a retroperitoneal mass beneath the body of pancreas compressing duodenum and the formation of splenic venous tumor thrombus. CT-guided retroperitoneal lesion biopsy was performed, and pathological analysis revealed the possibility of malignant tumor. He was inserted with a nasogastric tube and supported by parenteral nutrition. For further treatment, he was transferred to our tertiary care center. He had a past history of diabetes mellitus type II managed by diet and exercise and spinal dural arteriovenous fistulectomy. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, no peripheral lymph node enlargement, or palpable abdominal mass.
Laboratory tests showed a striking abnormality of white blood cell count of 18.4x109/L (normal, 3.5-9.5x109/L) and neutrophil cell count of 15.80x109/L (normal, 1.8-6.3x109/L). Coagulation abnormality was obvious as prothrombin time (PT) was prolonged by 7.1 seconds and international normalized ratio (INR) approached 1.81 (normal, 0.89-1.13). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 80 mm/h (normal, 0-15 mm/h). Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), CA19-9, and CA242 were normal, while CA125 was slightly elevated (47.27 U/mL; normal, <35.0 U/mL).
Abdominopelvic contrast-enhanced CT was suggestive of an amorphous conglomerated hypoattenuating mass underneath the body of pancreas compressed and infiltrated the third segment of duodenum. Splenic vein was not visible, and a longitudinal mildly enhanced mass was seen along and behind the body and tail of pancreas, clotting the superior mesenteric vein-portal vein (SMV-PV) confluence. Lymph nodes at the root of the mesentery and retroperitoneal region enlarged, and some were fused into bulky masses with indistinctive boundaries with aorta (Figure 1).
As the coagulation function improved by the supplement of vitamin K, the patient underwent a second percutaneous core needle biopsy of the retroperitoneal tumor guided by ultrasonography. The pathological analysis showed atypical tumor cells with ovoid or irregular (eg, kidney shaped) nuclei packed in sheets with intrasinusoidal infiltration. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed using DAKO EnVison  detection kit (Dako Denmark A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) and a panel of antibodies. The percentage of positive cells was semiquantitatively estimated and scored as follows: negative (-): <5% cells; weakly positive (+): 6%-30% cells; moderately positive (++): 31%-75% cells; strongly positive (+++): >75%. IHC analysis showed the following results: EMA+++, vimentin+++, LCA++, CD43+++, CD3-, CD20-, CD79a-, CD30+++, CD68 (KP1) -, CD56+, CD4++, CD8-, TIA1+, granzyme B++, ALK (CD246)-, ALK (1A4)+++ (nuclear/cytoplasmic), Ki67 70% (Figure 2). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detected ALK (2p23) gene rearrangement. The peripheral blood smear and lymphocyte subgroup analysis by FISH revealed no immature cells. Bone marrow smear and bone marrow aspiration revealed no evidence of lymphoma involvement.
Ultrasonography, chest X-ray, and thoracic CT detected neither peripheral nor mediastinal involvement. The final diagnosis was considered as primary retroperitoneal ALCL (stage IV) with duodenal obstruction and splenic venous tumor thrombosis. No source of infection was found in spite of leukocytosis, and broad-spectrum antibiotics had limited effects.
Following the initiation of CHOEP-21 regimen chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 1.4 g day (d)1, doxorubicin 40 mg d1, vincristine 4 mg d1, etoposide 100 mg d1-d3, and prednisolone 15 mg d1-d5, a cycle contained 21 days, and the patient underwent a total of eight cycles of chemotherapy), leukocyte count decreased significantly and was 4.51x109/L before the second cycle. The patient was able to tolerate oral intake after the second cycle. Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) showed no sign of lymphoma after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy (Figure 3). A contrast-enhanced CT was repeated after the sixth cycle of chemotherapy, and retroperitoneal masses and lymph nodes disappeared or shrank evidently to normal size compared to the previous CT scan. SMV and splenic veins were still occlusive with slightly enhanced thrombus, but the size of thrombus shrank (Figure 1). The patient was discharged after eight cycles of chemotherapy. He has lived for 4 months with no evidence of recurrence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6296199/,14,images/PMC6/PMC629/PMC6296199_01
PMC6321826_01,PMC6321826,Male,79.0,"A 79-year-old man developed dysarthria, dysphagia, and weakness of the hands 1 year before admission, which gradually progressed. Therefore, 6 months later, he was referred to a neurosurgical hospital. A definitive diagnosis was not confirmed even after brain computed tomography (CT). Five months later, he presented to our outpatient clinic. One month postpresentation, he was admitted to our hospital owing to appetite loss and dehydration. He had lost substantial weight (20 kg; starting weight: 75 kg; final weight: 55 kg; body height: 158 cm) in 2 years. He had no family history of neurodegenerative disease.
On admission, he was alert (Glasgow Coma Scale score: 15). We observed atrophy and fasciculation of the tongue; dysphagia; and dysarthria. Other cranial nerves were normal. Muscle atrophy was observed (Table 1). The first dorsal interosseous muscles and thenar eminence muscles showed ""split hand""2, 3 signs bilaterally (Figure 1). Gripping power (kg) was 0/0. MMT findings were as follows: deltoid (3/3), biceps (4+/4+), triceps (4+/4+), wrist ext. (3-/3-), wrist flex. (3+/3+), opponens pollicis (3/3), iliopsoas (4+/4+), quadriceps (4+/4+), hamstrings (4+/4+), tibialis anterior (5/5), and gastrocnemius (5/5). The muscle tone was flaccid in all four extremities. Neither sensory impairments nor cerebellar ataxias were observed. Deep tendon reflexes were as follows: upper extremities (2+/2+) and lower extremities (3+/3+). Abnormal reflexes/fasciculation details are shown in Table 1. No bladder or rectal disturbances, nor extrapyramidal disorders were observed. He could walk using a U-shaped walker. All other physical examination results were unremarkable.
The differential diagnoses were ALS, brain-stem tumor, cervical spondylosis, multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive muscular atrophy, myasthenia gravis, and myopathy.
Precontrast brain CT and cervical X-ray film excluded other intracranial or cervical abnormalities. Electrophysiological examinations of the bilateral median and ulnar nerves revealed mild reduction in amplitude in motor nerve velocity tests; no abnormality was recorded in sensory nerve velocity tests. Brain MRI was not performed because he had a DDD pacemaker. Lumbar puncture was not executed because he had lumbar spondylosis. Hence, the aforementioned differential diagnoses could not be completely excluded.
The final diagnosis was made by two neurologists based on the Awaji algorithm, combined with the El Escorial criteria, which are considerably useful for early ALS diagnosis.4 The diagnostic grade was ""probable.""4 
Regarding rehabilitation, because there is no effective training for symptoms of ALS, we modified his daily environment.1, 5 For 1 month after admission, his muscle weakness progressed noticeably.

The character of pain became sharp and frequent. The pain was localized to the left lower abdomen. There was no nausea and vomiting. There was no history of abdominal trauma. The patient had a congenital anomaly of the kidneys and uterus; there was no menstruation. The patient had undergone an appendectomy in the past. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile. The abdominal examination revealed pain and a mass in the left lower quadrant area upon palpation. The mass was approximately 4 x 5 cm in diameters and was not circumscribed. The patient had no rebound tenderness and muscle rigidity. Laboratory testing revealed the following: white blood cell count, 7.13 x 109/L; neutrophilic granulocytes, 76.8%; hemoglobin, 120 g/L; and platelet count, 322 x 109/L. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an intestinal stromal tumor (Figure 1) and pelvic kidneys (Figure 2). Digestive tract radiography showed possible extraintestinal involvement (Figure 3). An intestinal stromal tumor was diagnosed and an abdominal laparotomy was performed; however, the intestinal tract was normal and a mass was noted in the sigmoid flexure. The tumor exhibited exophytic growth without infiltration and was 6.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm in size. The tumor and colon (proximal and distal length, 10 cm; ~25 cm) were excised. A rapid frozen section pathologic examination revealed a solitary fibrous tumor (SFT). A colon anastomosis was performed and the patient had fully recovered 7-days post-operatively. The final diagnosis was an ectopic ovary with corpora lutea bleeding (Figure 4). The patient recovered well after surgery and there were no post-operative complications.

She had no complaints, except for recent unintended weight gain. Her past medical and surgical history are notable for a left breast lumpectomy (1973), a salpingectomy (1994), a hysterectomy without oophorectomy for NIC III (2005), and a left unilateral oophorectomy for ovarian torsion (2007). The patient used no medications and has no known allergies, and denied tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. The patient is monogamous and happily married. Her family history is notable for a sister who died of Hodgkin Lymphoma.
On physical exam, the patient was afebrile with normal vital signs. Her weight was 92.5 kg, 1.74 meters tall, with a BMI of 30.6. She appeared well hydrated with moist mucous membranes. She had an unremarkable exam - no findings of violaceous striae, acanthosis, acrochordons, or signs of virilization.
Laboratory results showed a normal complete blood count, mixed dyslipidemia, fasting blood glucose levels >125 mg/dl (normal range, 70-100 mg/dl) on more than two occasions, and HOMA1-IR index >2.5 (normal index, <= 2.5) ( Table 1); meeting the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and metabolic syndrome. Initial recommendations were lifestyle changes, including 30 minutes walks five days a week, and a nutritionist consult. Additionally, pharmacotherapy, sitagliptin/metformin (Janumet  , 50/1000mg) 1 tab daily, ezetimibe/simvastatin (Vytorin  ,10/40 mg) 1 tab daily, gemfibrozil (Lipontal  , 900 mg) 1 tab daily, and orlistat (Xerogras  , 120 mg) 1 cap daily, was initiated.
Simultaneously, a right upper quadrant ultrasound was ordered showing slight hepatic steatosis, as well as a round space occupying lesion with well-defined hyperechoic borders measuring 5.6x7.3cm in segment V of the right lobe suggestive of a hemangioma. Of note, a bilateral non-obstructive nephrolithiasis was observed ( Figure 1). Due to these findings, the patient was referred to a local hospital diagnostic center for imaging studies, a triphasic hepatic MRI was performed as part of an additional workup. This identified a 7.0x6.0cm right adrenal space occupying lesion suggestive of a large adrenal adenoma ( Figure 2). A hormone profile was performed with normal results - classifying this mass as a non-functional adenoma. Lack of reagents in local laboratories caused that the patients moved to Avila Clinic in Caracas (Capital of Venezuela) ( Table 2). The work up was completed with a serologic evaluation to rule out fungal infection with negative results for mycoplasma IgM (0.15; normal range: 0.00 - 0.90).
In April 2014, a right subcostal adrenalectomy was performed in at a level three hospital so as to ensure the presence of an intensive care unit due to the potential bleeding risk. The pathology report described a 4x7x6cm adrenal mass with a grey-yellow surface covered partially with a thick grey capsule with brown areas with a hemorrhagic and yellow adipose center. The microscopic evaluation showed an external layer of clear cortical cells of the adrenal granulosa; a center made of mature adipocytes and all three hematopoietic cell lines without calcifications or fibrosis. The final diagnosis was determined to be an adrenal myelolipoma ( Figure 3).

She denied any headache, hearing loss, tinnitus, back pain, joint pain or failure symptoms. There was no history of fracture, trauma or heart failure. On examination, she was unable to ambulate due to her left hip pain. There was no bowing of tibia or femur. Apart from her left hip, her musculoskeletal examinations of other joints and neurological examination were unremarkable. Biochemical tests revealed normal serum calcium and phosphorus with markedly raised alkaline phosphatase (Table 1). The initial differential diagnoses were osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, secondary metastasis or metabolic bone diseases. Her Xray of the hip revealed diffuse sclerotic left pelvic bone and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the hip revealed extensive marrow signal abnormalities at the left pelvic bone (Figure1). The radiological images above were reported as primary, metastatic bone disease or other metabolic bone disorders like PDB. As part of workup of bony lesion in adult to rule out possibility of secondary malignancy, contrast enhanced computed tomography of thorax, abdomen and pelvis (CECT-TAP) were performed which revealed a spiculated lung nodule at the left lower lung lobe, suggestive of lung malignancy (Figure 2).
In order to ascertain the lesion being a primary, metastatic bone tumour or PDB, an open biopsy of the left iliac bone was done. The histopathology result of bone biopsy of the left iliac bone was later reported as Paget's disease of the bone (Figure 3). A CT guided biopsy of the lung mass was done later which revealed adenocarcinoma of the lung (Figure 4). She had F-FDG PET-CECT Scan for staging evaluation and showed intense tracer uptake in the left lower lobe of the lung with multiple mediastinal lymph nodes as well as right sacral bone, right ilium and bodies of L3-L5 suggestive of new bony metastases. There was also diffuse sclerosis of the left hemi pelvis (ilium, ischium and pubic bone) with minimal metabolic activity in keeping with PDB (Figure 5A and B). The final diagnosis was metastatic bone disease secondary to adenocarcinoma of the lung with underlying PDB. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan was unable to be interpreted due to osteoblastic changes at the lumbar spine and hip. Her echocardiogram did not show any systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
Patient was initiated on high dose Vitamin D and subsequently IV Zoledronic acid for the treatment of the PDB.

PMC7481495_01,PMC7481495,Female,61.0,"A 61-year-old Hispanic woman presented with complaints of several years of chronic, dull abdominal pain. Her past medical history is significant for hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux, and former use of tobacco. She had no relevant surgical history. Computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated a multi-cystic abdominal mass located near the porta hepatis (Fig. 1) along with multiple low-attenuating peritoneal nodules.
Initial workup with endoscopic ultrasound could not localize the source of the mass, but it was visualized as separate from the pancreas, bowel, gallbladder, and bile ducts. Ultrasound findings were also concerning for a contained gallbladder perforation. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) sampling the mass near the gallbladder demonstrated benign ductal epithelial cells in a background of mucin and bile without the presence of malignant cells. The differential diagnosis at this point included a cystic neoplasm versus a contained, perforated gallbladder. Further imaging evaluation was planned. A subsequent CT in the following months showed near complete resolution of the multi-cystic mass near the porta hepatis. However, there was interval growth of the mesenteric nodules from the presenting CT, suspicious for pseudomyxoma peritonei, as well as a newly dilated appendix.
A diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. Intraoperative findings reported a grossly normal appendix and gallbladder, as well as absence of any fluid collection or cyst in the area of the porta hepatis. The appendix was removed, and a biopsy of a peritoneal nodule was obtained. On final pathology, the appendix was unremarkable, and the peritoneal nodule was determined to be a mesothelial cyst.
Further workup included a colonoscopy, which was normal. A transvaginal ultrasound was concerning for endometrial hyperplasia, although she has never had abnormal uterine bleeding and was not followed by gynecology-oncology. Subsequently, the patient experienced worsening abdominal discomfort, and surveillance CT imaging continued to show an increase in the size and number of peritoneal nodules.
A second diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal biopsy was then performed given the patient's worsening symptoms and imaging findings. Intraoperative findings reported diffuse mucinous and gelatinous material throughout the abdomen. Bilateral ovaries and the gallbladder appeared normal. Biopsy of a peritoneal nodule revealed a peritoneal inclusion cyst without malignant cells.
Given the benign findings on surgical pathology with the two previous operations, she continued to be treated with conservative management. However, as her abdominal pain worsened in subsequent years, exploratory laparotomy and surgical debulking were performed for therapeutic benefit and tissue diagnosis.
During laparotomy, a large cystic mass seen emanating from the small bowel mesentery and involving the porta hepatis, gallbladder, stomach, and duodenum. A smaller, multi-loculated cystic mass was also found in the lesser sac. Additional, innumerable small cystic lesions through the abdomen were removed. Grossly, the abdominal mass specimen, measuring 26 x 18 x 8 cm, showed multi-loculated cysts filled with serous fluid (Fig. 2). On immunohistochemistry, tissue from the large cystic mass stained positive for calretinin, CK4/5, CK7, and D2-40 (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The final diagnosis was benign multi-cystic peritoneal mesothelioma (BMPM).
Our patient's case was unique in the sense that the initial, loculated cystic mass near her porta hepatis appeared to spontaneously regress in the span of two months, as detected by follow-up CT. Yet, subsequent imaging studies performed for continued abdominal pain re-demonstrated the cystic mass. Also, initial endoscopic ultrasound suggested gallbladder perforation though the gallbladder was found to be intact on laparoscopy. The ultrasound findings of the gallbladder may have represented primary lesions of BMPM or secondary changes from an inflammatory response instead. Taken together, these regressions and growths may suggest that both reactive and neoplastic processes were components in this patient's disease. A major learning point from this study is to be able to recognize BMPM lesions or changes from inflammatory responses and how they differ from gallbladder perforation on ultrasound of the abdomen, specifically in the gallbladder, given the context.
Because our patient was a higher risk candidate for debulking surgery, multiple laparoscopies spanning five years form initial presentation were performed prior to laparotomy. This case highlights the difficulty of diagnosing BMPMs and differentiating it from malignant diseases that can present similarly and that can be associated with significantly worse prognosis. Given the rarity of this disease, defined management strategies have yet to be demonstrated with solid evidence. Our case is unique in the sense that our patient ultimately required several surgical biopsies before final diagnosis could be made.
After discussion with the medical oncologists at our facility, the patient elected to follow recommendations for continued surveillance of symptoms and CT imaging as needed. She will be followed as an outpatient given the high risk of recurrence. Should symptoms recur and if transformation to malignant pathology is identified on pathology, HIPEC may be considered.

PMC4531569_01,PMC4531569,Female,38.0,"A 38-year-old, gravida 4, para 2, female Korean patient presenting with indigestion and vague abdominal discomfort of several months' duration was referred from a private clinic for a large retroperitoneal mass that was discovered on abdomen computer tomography. She had suffered from cervical tuberculosis 7 years ago, and this had been confirmed by excisional biopsy at a private clinic, and it was eradicated after a 1 year treatment with anti-tuberculosis medications. The large cystic abdominal mass was palpated on her right flank and in the RLQ abdomen on the physical examination. It was mobile, non-tender and estimated to be about 8 cm in diameter. The rest of her pelvic examination was unremarkable. The laboratory findings including colonoscopy and serum tumor markers (CEA, CA 125, and CA 19-9) were within the normal limits. Imaging studies on abdomen and pelvis computer tomography showed an unilocular cystic mass, 10x8x6 cm3 in dimensions, was located at the inferior aspect of the liver and posterior along the right colon, and the right retroperitoneal mass had displaced the right colon ventromedially. It was an encapsulated cystic mass that contained fluids, and there was no lesion in the pelvic organs (Figure 1).
A celiotomy was performed; there was a large cystic retroperitoneal mass adhered to the right colon and its mesocolon, right kidney and duodenum, but it had not invaded to the adjacent organs. Macroscopically there was no lesion observed in the ovaries and fallopian tubes, appendix, right colon, kidneys and pancreas. The retroperitoneal tumor was completely removed with no spillage of its contents, and no combined resection with the associated organs was performed.
Upon gross examination, the specimen was a thin-walled, multilocular cyst with a dominant loculus that measured 10.0x7.5x5.5 cm3. The external surface is smooth and pinkish. Upon opening it, it contained mucinous fluids and inner surface is smooth. The wall of the cyst contained smaller cysts; the largest of these measured 0.8 cm in diameter. The thickness of the walls was less than 0.1 cm. There are no solid areas or papillary projections. On the histologic examination, the cyst was lined by a single layer of tall columnar epithelium with clear cytoplasm and small nuclei that were basely located in the cells (Figure 2). There was no papillary growth or stromal invasion of epithelium. The cyst wall consisted of fibrocollagenous tissue of varying cellularity and vascularity. No pancreatic or ovarian components were found (Figure 3). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the lining cells were positive for cytokeratin, cytokeratin 7, CAM 5.2, and carcinoembryogenic antigen, but the cells were negative for cytokeratin 19, epithelial membrane antigen, estrogen and progesterone (Figure 4).
The final diagnosis was primary mucinous cystadenoma arising from the retroperitoneum. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery, and there was no lesion or recurrence on the follow-up abdomen and pelvis computer tomography at postoperative one year.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4531569/,4,images/PMC4/PMC453/PMC4531569_01
PMC6509196_01,PMC6509196,Female,63.0,"Ms. S was a 63-year-old female with no previous medical or psychiatric history. In July 2017, she presented with dizziness, weakness, chronic shoulder pain, and high blood pressure. She informed her family that she felt helpless and sick. The preliminary examination revealed nothing but multiple lacunar infarcts in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. On September 17, 2017, she exhibited anhedonia, fear, anxiety, impatience, and a propensity to cry after being annoyed with others. She was examined in the psychiatric unit of the local hospital. Her value on the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) was 53.75, which pointed to mild depression, whereas on the Hastgawa Dementia Scale (HDS), she scored 13.0, which suggested probable dementia (education: primary school). The memory quotient (MQ) of Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) was 59. Her sleep was normal. She was diagnosed with depression, and sertraline 50 mg/day was prescribed. Her symptoms nonetheless worsened with insomnia, garrulity, irritability, and gait imbalance. Her memory function deteriorated, and she became disoriented. The psychiatrist changed the antidepressant drug to venlafaxine 75 mg/day on October 8, 2017. However, instead of improving, the condition rapidly worsened. Her speech became hypophonic and monotonous with a paucity of content. She was sleepy during the day and sometimes burst into tears. Her arms curled up, indicating panic. She developed psychomotor retardation, responded poorly to questions, experienced visual hallucination, and suffered from a rigid posture with paroxysmal myoclonus and an inability to walk. The changes in her symptoms were initially considered to be side effects of venlafaxine. Two weeks later, she had deteriorated further and was unable to talk, exhibiting dysphagia and suffering from urinary incontinence. The symptoms did not improve after the withdrawal of the antidepressant. An assessment of her electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed generalized slow activity ( Figure 1A ). She was then transferred to the neurologic ward of our hospital where the following neurological findings were detected: akinetic mutism (AM), normal muscle strength, increased muscle tension, brisk tendon reflexes, and unresponsive pathologic reflexes. We performed a hematology screen for endocrine, metabolic, autoimmune, neoplastic, and infectious diseases, which were all negative. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies, including a paraneoplastic, an autoimmune antibody panel, and a tubercular, fungal antibody survey were also negative. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) of the brain MRI showed hyperintensities in the bilateral frontal lobe, corona radiate, and near the anterior and posterior horns of the lateral ventricle ( Figure 2A ). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed hyperintensities in the bilateral caudate nucleus and putamen ( Figure 2B ). A diagnosis of CJD was considered. One week after admission, the second EEG was performed, revealing partially periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWC;  Figure 1B ). No gene mutations associated with genetic CJD were found, but methionine homozygotes were detected at codon 129 of the prion protein gene. The final diagnosis was probable sCJD according to the diagnostic criteria for sCJD. Antibiotics, antiviral, and corticosteroid therapies had been tried since admission, but none of them worked. Ultimately, she was discharged from the hospital.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6509196/,2,images/PMC6/PMC650/PMC6509196_01
PMC6355419_01,PMC6355419,Male,78.0,"A 78-year-old man underwent flexible bronchoscopy 2 years previously to evaluate his shortness of breath. Computed tomography (CT) showed reticular markings, slight traction bronchiectasis, lobar volume loss, and ground glass opacification (GGO) on both sides of the lungs. All autoantibodies that could be inspected at that time were negative. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed a cell count of 11x105/mL, and lymphocytes were dominant (62%). From these clinical and radiological results, the final diagnosis was f-NSIP, and prednisolone (PSL) 20 mg/day (approximately 0.5 mg/kg) was administered. However, as PSL was tapered over the following two years, the symptoms of shortness of breath worsened and were accompanied by increased GGO on chest CT findings (Fig. 1a). The dosage of PSL was 30 mg/day, and cyclosporine A (CsA) 100 mg/day was supplemented.
Two months after intensification of the treatment, his respiratory condition deteriorated, and he was hospitalized. His subjective symptom was only cough without dyspnea. His arterial oxygen tension was 56.5 Torr, arterial carbon dioxide tension was 40.5 Torr on room air, and serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) was 2,628 U/mL on the day of admission. His hemoglobin A1c was elevated to 7.1%, indicating the development of steroid-induced diabetes mellitus (DM). Chest CT showed slightly expanded GGO with bronchiectasis (Fig. 1b). A pulmonary function test revealed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 1.88 L, a percent predicted FVC 60.5%, and percent decreased diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide 42.3% at admission. CsA was increased to 150 mg/day for the disease control of NSIP.
The oxygen requirement further increased with deterioration of the chest CT findings on day 10 of admission. He was diagnosed with acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia, so high-dose corticosteroid (CS) therapy (methyl PSL 500 mg/day) was administered from days 11 to 13.
On day 14, the patient had a fever with excretion of a large amount of sputum, so antibiotics were administered. However, the fever did not lessen, and his respiratory condition deteriorated further. Chest CT showed that the GGO in both lungs had changed to consolidation, and the area had spread by day 19 (Fig. 1c). beta-D glucan, serum Aspergillus antibody, and Aspergillus antigen were 10,300 pg/mL, positive, and >5.0, respectively, and sputum culture revealed Aspergillus species. IPA was diagnosed, and antifungal agents were initiated; however, his respiratory condition was not improved. Although he underwent tracheal intubation, he ultimately died of respiratory failure on day 33. The clinical course is shown in Fig. 2.
A pathological autopsy revealed that both sides of the lungs were heavy and that necrotic lesions were observed macroscopically (Figs. 3a and 3b; arrows). Elastica Van Gieson (EVG) stain of the basal part of the left inferior lobe revealed homogeneous interstitial inflammation, fibrosis with thickening of interlobular septa, and no honeycomb lesions, findings that were compatible with f-NSIP (Fig. 3c). Many Aspergillus fungi were detected on the fibrotic parts and in airspaces (Fig. 3d). There were many lesions of bronchial pneumonia in the inferior lobe of the right lung (Fig. 3e). Some Aspergillus fungi had invaded the pulmonary arteries (Fig. 3f).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6355419/,6,images/PMC6/PMC635/PMC6355419_01
PMC5726673_01,PMC5726673,Male,0.0,"A male full-term newborn, in good health conditions, upon birth presented erythematous plaques and papules, covered with disseminated brownish crusts and erythematous macerated lesions in the inguinal region (Figures 1 to 4). At four days old, our medical team decided to perform an incisional biopsy of the trunk lesion.
Serologies for congenital infectious diseases, blood count, biochemistry, and maternal autoantibodies (FAN, anti-Ro, anti-La) presented normal results. Histopathological examination showed cells with lobed core permeating the epidermis. The immunohistochemical study was positive for Cd1a in mononuclear cells from the high dermis and S100 in the epidermis, reaching a diagnosis of LCH (Figure 5).
Laboratory screening for systemic disease through hematology, according to the LCH-2009 Protocol from the Histiocytosis International Society, showed mild anemia (Hct 29%, Hgb 10.0g/dl) and hypoalbuminemia (2.4g/dl). Normal urine osmolarity, skeletal X-ray, and upper GI endoscopy were performed. Abdominal ultrasound showed the liver in the upper limit of normality and a slightly enlarged spleen. The bone marrow biopsy did not obtain enough material for analysis, and the liver biopsy showed nonspecific inflammatory changes.
In only a few weeks, the patient developed hepatosplenomegaly, hypoalbuminemia, hypofibrinogenemia, worsening anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Chest computed tomography showed sub-pleural bubbles. These findings have defined the progression to the systemic form and chemotherapy was begun with prednisone and vinblastine, according to that set forth in the LCH-2009 protocol.
In the fifth week of treatment, the patient developed suppurative otorrhea in the right ear without general symptoms. It was difficult to establish whether there was progression of disease with extension to another organ (bone), whether the clinical picture was secondary to otitis externa due to the disease itself or whether the picture was of infectious nature. The infant was hospitalized and treated with cefepima, producing a good response and complete resolution of the lesion after seven days of treatment. The final diagnosis was necrotizing otitis externa.
In the sixth week the patient was classified as ""stable disease with involvement of target organ"", and the protocol was followed as planned, with intravenous chemotherapy for six more weeks.
In the 12th week reassessment, there were signs of progression of the disease, with a worsening of the skin lesions and hematological parameters. The examination showed ulcerated lesions in the lower abdomen and inguinal region, crusted lesions in the pinna and retroauricular regions. According to the LCH-2009 protocol, the patient was hospitalized and underwent salvage chemotherapy (cladribine + cytarabine). The patient presented infectious complications and severe pancytopenia, leading to the patient's admission to the ICU. The patient also continued to develop hepatosplenomegaly and recurrent otitis. In view of the disease progression, the patient received chemotherapy for refractory multisystemic disease, and died 11 months later due to septic shock.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5726673/,5,images/PMC5/PMC572/PMC5726673_01
PMC3635692_01,PMC3635692,Male,24.0,"A 24-year-old male presented with recurrent abdominal pain that had started to worsen 2 months previously. He had no relevant family or past medical history. On admission, his vital signs were stable. Physical examination revealed slight tenderness in the epigastric area with no sign of peritoneal irritation. Biochemical investigations yielded the following findings: white blood cell count 6,300/mm3, serum glucose 93 mg/dl, total bilirubin 1.1 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 28 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase 13 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase 61 IU/l, gamma-glutamyltransferase 28 IU/l, amylase 115 IU/l, lipase 45 U/l, alpha-fetoprotein 2.07 ng/ml, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 23.68 U/ml, carcinoembryonic antigen 4.05 ng/ml and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 0.3 mg/l.
Abdominal computed tomography showed a large stone in the common bile duct (CBD) with no marked upstream duct dilatation, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) demonstrated the same stone at the same level with compression of the CBD, suggesting Mirizzi's syndrome. The location of the impacted stone was suspected to be the cystic duct rather than the CBD, which could cause compression of the CBD (fig. 1a). Subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed that the large impacted stone was located in the central CBD. Injected contrast filled the dilated upstream cystic duct and CBD at the same time and demonstrated that the large stone was laterally compressing the CBD (fig. 1a). This finding strongly suggested that an impacted stone in the cystic duct of the gallbladder had caused Mirizzi's syndrome. Selective CBD cannulation was difficult due to the narrowing caused by extrinsic compression and variation in the common pathway of the CBD. However, the gallbladder was not distended and laboratory findings revealed no obstructive pattern typically seen in Mirizzi's syndrome. Following the insertion of a 7-Fr plastic stent (Cook Endoscopy, Winston-Salem, N.C., USA) into the CBD, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was planned.
Laparoscopic operative findings showed that the gallbladder was atrophic; thus, the surgeon planned to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy and to remove the impacted stone via CBD exploration. Intraoperatively, the stone in the CBD was considered to be impacted due to the atrophic gallbladder. However, following removal of the gallbladder and the large impacted stone, surgical exploration revealed a bulging cystic lesion and the surgeon could not find the plastic stent inserted previously in the CBD (fig. 2). Thus, the surgery was converted to laparotomy, which revealed that the saccular dilated cystic lesion with a large impacted stone was a diverticular choledochal cyst. The type II choledochal cyst was excised and choledochoduodenostomy was performed. The final diagnosis was confirmed histologically, the specimen showing chronic inflammatory infiltration without dysplasia and denuded epithelium (fig. 3).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635692/,5,images/PMC3/PMC363/PMC3635692_01
PMC8317259_01,PMC8317259,Male,21.0,"A 21-year-old male complained of asthenia and intermittent fever for 10 days was referred to our department for surgery from the department of hematology, as an ultrasound showed an undefined lesion on his liver. He has a history of severe aplastic anemia. Hepatitis B virus infection history or exposure in the infected area was denied. We learned that the patient took long-term exogenous testosterone for stimulating hematopoiesis. Upon examination he showed facial acne and facial hair. He was weak with a body-mass index of 20.5 kg/m2. On deep palpation he had increased mild tenderness of the right upper abdominal quadrant. His admission test was significant for declined leukocytes level (1.45 x 109/L; lower limit of normal [LLN], 4.0 x 109/L), declined erythrocytes level (1.17 x 1012/L; LLN, 4.0 x 1012/L) and declined platelets level (3 x 109/L; LLN, 100 x 109/L). Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were normal. His abdominal magnetic resonance imaging showed the lesion was markedly hyperintense at T2 with a range of 65.0 x 45.0 mm, and normal liver contour with no signs of liver cirrhosis. The mass was enhanced in the arterial phase and persisted in the portal venous and hepatobiliary phases (Figure 1A). Despite
the patient having asthenia and intermittent fever syndrome, the liver tuberculoma was a likely diagnosis. A test result for tuberculosis was negative. A liver biopsy was assigned, because the patient was scheduled for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and immune inhibitor therapy. In this patient, liver biopsy revealed that the focal area of the liver plate was thickened with more pseudo-adenoid structures, slightly alien cells. Nevertheless, there was still divarication over the diagnosis of either benign or malignant as immunohistochemical stains for hepPar-1, glutamine synthetase, and heat shock protein 70 were positive, which are hepatocellular carcinoma markers. But cells were negative for glypican-3, and there was a lack of significant evidence for frank malignant behavior, Immunohistochemical staining showed that beta-catenin was positive on the membranes, with < 10% positive for Ki67, consistent with a hepatic adenoma (Figures 1B,C). In the meantime, we excluded the extramedullary hematopoietic foci as no characteristic signs were found via microscopy. Extramedullary hematopoiesis, which commonly presents as granulocytes, erythrocytes, and giant cells are all visible, and erythroid hyperplasia is obvious.
The key to the correct diagnosis is recognizing that the presence of a liver mass in the background of normal liver parenchyma is unlikely to represent hepatocellular carcinoma, especially at a normal AFP level. Considering the patient's past medical history, negative blood tests, and the pathology of liver biopsy, the final diagnosis was identified as androgen-related hepatic adenoma. Then we withdrew the androgen for observation. Surprisingly, the lesion shrank significantly after 38 days. The patient was transferred to the department of hematology and completed hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The lesion diminished gradually over a two-year follow-up (Figure 1D).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8317259/,4,images/PMC8/PMC831/PMC8317259_01
PMC3489072_01,PMC3489072,Female,67.0,"A 67-year-old female was evaluated because of a progressive increase of hair growth of upper lip, chin, and linea alba, deepening of voice, increase in libido, mood instability, increment of muscle mass, and onset of frontal alopecia during the last six months. A transvaginal ultrasonography performed the previous year showed no abnormalities in her reproductive tract. She had two pregnancies, and menopause took place at the age of fifty. Her medical history included a total thyroidectomy for goiter and cholecystectomy in 2006, irritable bowel syndrome, and severe osteopenia treated with calcium (1000 mg daily) and ibandronate (150 mg once a month). Body weight was stable (body mass index, 30.4 kg/m2) and the blood pressure was normal (130/70 mmHg). On physical examination, a clitoromegaly, increased hair growth (20 on the Ferriman-Gallwey scale), and marked frontal alopecia were confirmed. The blood tests showed normal values of hemoglobin, haematocrit, and eritrocyte number and no abnormalities in lipid profile, serum electrolytes, and glucose level. Serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP), CA15-3, CA 125, CA 19.9, CEA, hepatic enzymes, and alkaline phosphatase were all within the normal range. Hormonal profile revealed increased total serum levels of testosterone (T) (4.33 ng/mL, normal range in women, 0.15-0.7), delta-4-androstenedione (3.5 ng/mL, normal range, 0.5-1.5), and DHEA (6.2 ng/mL, normal range, 0.7-3.1). The following were within the normal range: 17beta-estradiol (14.6 pg/mL, normal range for menopause, <18 to 110), estrone (28 pg/mL, normal range for menopause, 7-40) follicle-stimulating hormone (82.96 mIU/mL, normal range for menopause, 2.58-150.53), luteinizing hormone (28.09 mIU/mL, normal range for menopause, 1.78-92.10), DHT (38.4 pg/mL, normal range, 35-185), sex hormone binding globulin (27.5 nmol/l, normal range, 20-90), ACTH (20 pg/mL, normal range, 5-60), cortisol (10.2 mug/dL, normal range, 7-25) and prolactin (12 ng/mL, normal range, 2-29). A 2 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test was performed. T, androstenedione and DHEA plasma levels remained unvaried. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed a solid, ovoid, sharp margins well-vascularized mass. The abdomen contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a solid and heterogeneous mass of 2.7 x 2.9 cm in the right ovary, characterized by a hypo-intense core set against the background of the uterus with regular margins. The left ovary was normal. The patient underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The pathology study confirmed the presence of an encapsulated yellow solid lobulated tumor of 3.5 cm, of hard-parenchymatous consistency on the right ovary. Furthermore, a polipoid neoplasm of the endometrium (1 cm size) was found in the surgical specimen of the uterus. Microscopical examination of the neoplasm located in the right ovary revealed a proliferation of tubular structures lined by one layer of cuboidal epithelial cells with Sertoli cell appearance, amphophilic vacuolated clear cytoplasm, oval basal nuclei, and scant nucleoli (Fig. 1A). The intervening stroma contained nests of variable numbers of large monomorphic cuboidal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and central located nuclei with the aspect of Leydig cells (Fig. 1A). Mitotic figures, vascular invasion, and necrosis were not observed. Immunohistochemistry showed strong positivity of the neoplasm for inhibin and pancytokeratine (Fig. 1B and C) and negativity for vimentine, placental alkaline phosphatase, synaptophysin, cytokeratine 20, and alpha-fetoprotein; less than 5% of tumor cells were positively stained for the proliferation marker Ki67/MIB-1. The final diagnosis was SLCT of the right ovary pT1a/FIGO IA. Concerning the neoplasm found in the endometrium, the diagnosis was endometrioid adenocarcinoma (G2 pT1B/FIGO IA, FIGO 2009 staging) (Fig. 1D). Two weeks after surgery, the patient reported a gradual and a progressive regression of alopecia and a recovery in voice tone. The treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation was not performed, and the patient underwent follow-up checkup every three months. Twelve months postoperatively, the patient was in good health, alopecia (Fig. 2A and B) and hirsutism (Fig. 2C and D) had substantially improved, and total serum T levels (0.8 ng/mL), delta-4-androstenedione (0.8 ng/mL), and DHEA (1.5 ng/mL) were within the normal range. MRI with and without contrast of the upper and lower abdomen did not show pelvic or distant pathological processes. Mammography and pelvic and breast ultrasound were normal.

He believed that the mass first appeared after he bumped his head, but he was not sure. The patient denied any drainage, pain, numbness, tingling, fever, or redness. Medications included acetaminophen, bacitracin, ranitidine, ketotifen fumarate, ammonium lactate, castellani colorless topical paint, urea 20% cream, celecoxib, and cyclobenzaprine. The patient denied any smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Family history was non-contributory, and he had no known drug allergies. On physical exam, he was found to have a mobile and cystic appearing right parietal scalp mass with a punctum. The differential diagnosis included an epidermal inclusion cyst, pilar cyst, or lipoma.
The patient underwent operative excision five days later under monitored anesthesia care. An elliptical incision was made around the lesion, including the punctum. The cyst was circumferentially dissected. It spontaneously ruptured and the specimen was passed off to pathology. The patient returned for a post-operative visit nine days later. He complained of right scalp incisional pain that was slowly improving but did not have any other issues. His staples were removed at that visit. Post-operative photos are displayed in Figures 1, 2.

PMC3791969_01,PMC3791969,Male,68.0,"A 68-year-old man presented to a primary care skin cancer clinic in Melbourne, Australia. He was concerned about a skin lesion on his mid back which he reported having traumatised by scratching a week earlier (Figure 1). The patient had not been previously aware of this lesion. There was no personal or family history of melanoma. A single, well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma had been excised from his nose 3 years earlier. There was no history of excessive occupational or recreational sun exposure and he had never patronised solariums or used welding equipment.
On examination the patient had Fitzpatrick skin type 2 with significant actinic damage to the face, forearms and dorsum of the hands, with multiple solar lentigines and scattered small actinic keratoses. The lesion of concern was located on the central back. No other lesions suspicious for skin cancer were discovered.
A whole body skin examination was undertaken with the aid of a Heine Delta 20 non-polarizing dermatoscope (Heine Optotechnik, Herrshing, Germany). Digital clinical and dermatoscopic images were taken with a Medicam 800 Fotofinder non-polarized camera (Fotofinder Systems GmbH, Aichner, Birnbach, Germany), the dermatoscopy images being at 20 x magnification.
The lesion of concern on the patient's central back was 6mm in diameter (Figure 2). It was non-pigmented, nodular and centrally ulcerated being covered in a yellow, dried, serous exudate. Being non-pigmented, this lesion could not be assessed algorithmically for clues to melanoma. Ulceration in the absence of trauma is described as a clue to malignancy, but in this case a history of prior trauma was present. Dermatoscopically the lesion was a non-pigmented, structureless yellow with three terminal hairs emanating from it. Central structureless red colour was evidence of ulceration as was a single thread of adherent fibre. Vessels observed dermatoscopically were very sparse, there being just a few vessels as curved vessels and dots. Although a pattern of polymorphous vessels including dots is a published clue to melanoma, there were insufficient vessels visible to constitute a clue to the specific diagnosis in this case. Of diagnostic significance was the presence of three terminal hairs protruding from the lesion, visible both clinically and dermatoscopically. This caused the clinician to suspect that the lesion was melanocytic, and therefore amelanotic melanoma was considered as a possible diagnosis.
An excisional biopsy was performed with the excision submitted for assessment by a specialist dermatopathologist. Histologic sections (Figures 3-11) showed a compound melanocytic proliferation with two components, the first consisting of bland nevus cells, which matured with descent and tracked down adnexal structures in a congenital pattern. The second component, by contrast, was comprised of centrally positioned atypical aggregates of grossly distended epithelioid melanocytes, exhibiting a pseudo-xanthomatous balloon cell change in their cytoplasm, and pleomorphic vesicular nuclei with nucleoli. These cells did not mature with descent, exhibited 4 mitoses per mm sq, and filled the dermis to a depth of 2 mm (level 4). The final diagnosis was: Malignant melanoma of balloon cell type; Clark level 4; Breslow thickness 2 mm, arising within a pre-existing congenital nevus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3791969/,11,images/PMC3/PMC379/PMC3791969_01
PMC4434163_01,PMC4434163,Female,56.0,"A 56-year-old was referred to a gynecologic oncologist after an initial work-up for hematuria and postmenopausal bleeding for greater than two years revealed a 30 x 15 cm complex cystic mass in the pelvis. She had no other complaints at presentation, specifically denying abdominal pain, changes in appetite, satiety, and bowel habits. She had a medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but was otherwise uncomplicated. Family history was negative with the exception of an unknown type of cancer in her sister.
On physical exam, she was noted to have a normal cervix and vagina. She had a palpable pelvic mass extending from pelvis to umbilicus. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous probable soft tissue mass without discernable uterus. Ovaries were not identified, and there was no free fluid in the cul-de-sac. Abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography showed a very large pelvic mass measuring at least 25 x 30 x 15 cm arising from the right adnexa and extending into the abdomen, displacing the surrounding structures. The cephalad extent of tumor was at the L2-L3 disc level. Tumor markers, including CA 125, CEA, and CA 19-9 were within normal limits.
The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, radical tumor debulking, resection of right and left sided retroperitoneal masses, right sided complete ureterolysis, extensive lysis of adhesions, infracolic omentectomy, and diagnostic cystoscopy. At time of the procedure, the mass was noted to be a large approximately 26 cm uterus with the extrauterine component continuous with the corpus. The extrauterine component consisted of large bilateral extensions of the mass from the uterus into the retroperitoneum and pelvic sidewall, the right side being 15 x 20 cm and the left 10 x 8 cm. Extraction of the entirety of the mass took approximately 6 h due to dense adhesions and its large nature. The mass was noted to be soft and spongy. Multiple intraoperative frozen sections were diagnosed as smooth muscle neoplasm without cytologic atypia. The mass was highly vascular, and transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells was required during the procedure. At the end of the case, no visible tumor remained.
Tissue analysis was performed by a board certified pathologist with specialization in gynecologic pathology. On gross examination, multiple specimens containing tumor measured 84 cm in aggregate. Tumor involving the surface of the uterus had a lobulated, red appearance (Fig. 1a). Microscopically the tumor was composed of cytologically bland interlacing fascicles of smooth muscle, which showed infiltration into the surrounding myometrium (Fig. 1b). Cytologic atypia, increased mitotic activity and tumor-cell necrosis were not seen despite extensive sampling. Immunohistochemical staining showed lesional cells to be positive for SMA and negative for HMB-45, with a Ki-67 index of < 1%. Multiple areas of the tumor showed collections of cells with adipocytic differentiation, confirmed by an S100 stain (Fig. 1c). Extensive atherosis and thrombosis of intratumoral blood vessels were noted, as well as focal lymphovascular space invasion (Fig. 1d). The final diagnosis was cotyledonoid dissecting lipoleiomyoma with focal vascular invasion.
The patient was discharged from the hospital without complications 5 days following surgery and was healing well without evidence of recurrence 2 months post-surgery (Fig. 2).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4434163/,5,images/PMC4/PMC443/PMC4434163_01
PMC5711662_01,PMC5711662,Male,79.0,"A 79-year-old Asian (Japanese) patient was referred to our hospital to undergo further examination for a right testicular tumor. The patient had glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, and benign prostate hyperplasia. The only remarkable physical examination finding was a right testicular mass that was elastic and hard, measuring 5 cm in diameter. The laboratory findings, including several tumor markers (HCG, <0.1 mIU/mL; CEA, 3.3 ng/mL; AFP, 3 ng/mL; CA19-9, 11 U/mL; CA125, 17 U/mL; SCC, 0.8 U/mL; NSE, 11.0 U/mL; sIL-2R, 448.4 U/ml), were normal. CT revealed right testicular mass of 5.4 cm in diameter, without invasion or metastasis [Fig. 1] (see Fig. 2).
Right radical orchiectomy was performed based on the clinical diagnosis of testicular cancer. The resected elastic firm specimen was 6.8 x 4.3 x 5.3 cm. The resected specimen showed an enlarged testis occupied by a white solid tumor. No normal testis was observed. Histologically, the tumor obliterated the underlying testicular parenchyma and there was intertubular growth of tumor cells in peripherally. Neoplastic cells showed plasmacytoid appearance of eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with central nucleoli (Fig. 3a). Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for lambda light chain (Fig. 3b) and negative for kappa light chain (Fig. 3c). Amyloid sedimented on vascular walls and basement membrane of testicular tubules. Amyloid deposits were Congo red-positive (Fig. 3d). Based on these findings, monoclonal plasma cells grew in neoplastic and immunoglobulin light chain had deviation. The tumor was therefore diagnosed as testicular plasmacytoma.
Based on the diagnosis of testicular plasmacytoma, blood and urinary protein analyses, PET-CT, and bone marrow aspiration were performed. M protein was not detected and PET-CT revealed no irregular findings. Thus, the final diagnosis was plasmacytoma arising from the testis. The patient is currently free from recurrence at four months after undergoing radical orchiectomy, without any additional systemic chemotherapy. PET-CT showed no metastasis. The serum immunoglobulin findings were as follows: IgG, 1048 mg/dL; IgA, 165 mg/dL; IgM, 33 mg/dL; IgD, <0.6 mg/dL; and IgE, 258 mg/dL. A serum protein sub-fraction analysis revealed the following findings: Alb, 63.2%; alpha1-glob, 3.7%; alpha2-glob, 8.1%; beta1-glob, 5.6%; beta2-glob, 4.5%; and gamma-glob, 14.9%. M protein was not detected in the patient's urine or serum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711662/,1,images/PMC5/PMC571/PMC5711662_01
PMC3280477_01,PMC3280477,Female,48.0,"A 48-year-old woman with a long-standing history of intractable migraine headaches was admitted to our institution's specialty headache unit for aggressive management. She had no known history of peripheral vascular or cardiac disease but has been admitted multiple times for treatment of her headaches since her initial diagnosis in 2003. During the course of each of these hospitalizations, she had received one to two courses of dihydroergotamine mesylate (DHE) 45. During this admission she received two courses of DHE 0.5 mg x 1, then 1 mg every 8 h for a total of eight doses, on days 1-3 and the second course of therapy on days 7-9. Several hours after the final dose of her second round she became obtunded, minimally responsive and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/45 mm Hg. On physical examination her abdomen was moderately distended with few bowel sounds. Her lactate acid level was 4.5 mmol/l, white blood cell count was 18.0 (with 17% bands), and stool was Clostridium difficile negative.
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, given intravenous fluid boluses, started on vasopressors, and given broad spectrum antibiotics. She eventually required intubation. Her chest radiograph was unremarkable, and her abdominal x-rays showed only mild prominence of the colon. Over the next several hours she became progressively acidotic with a worsening bandemia. A bedside colonoscopy showed diffuse ischemic colitis with fecal impaction and no pseudomembranes (fig. 1). The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent a laparotomy. Operative findings showed a peritoneal cavity filled with murky, foul-smelling fluid and gangrene of the descending colon was seen with necrosis in the area immediately distal to the splenic flexure to the sigmoid colon. A large amount of impacted stool was present in the left colon. The vasculature of this area of colon was intact with audible Doppler signals. Upon removal of the gangrenous bowel the patient's condition improved promptly.
Final pathology on the surgical specimen showed 86 cm of patchy, dark green/black large bowel, consistent with ischemic necrosis. The bowel wall was intact throughout. The final diagnosis was gangrenous large bowel, ischemic colitis with thrombi or emboli noted. A hypercoaguable panel was performed following the operation and the patient was negative for clotting disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3280477/,1,images/PMC3/PMC328/PMC3280477_01
PMC7537991_01,PMC7537991,Male,78.0,"We present the case of a 78-year-old male known with AS and multiple hospitalizations in the last year due to decompensations of his heart failure, who was referred to our cardiology center for further investigations and treatment of the AV disease. On admission, the patient's general status was severely altered with symptoms of angina, NYHA III functional class and extreme fatigue. The clinical examination revealed a pale and underweight patient with peripheral edemas, irregular heart rhythm and a significant systolic ejection murmur (grade III/VI) on the entire heart projection area with a maximum of intensity in the AV projection area and radiation to both carotid arteries.
Biological investigations revealed a mild normocytic, normochromic anemia (hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL), normal lipid profile under statins, normal thyroid function (TSH 1.28 mcUI/mL), normal renal function for his age (creatinine 0.94 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate 77 mL/min/1.73m2) with no proteinuria and elevated cardiac biomarkers (NT-proBNP: 3125 pg/mL and high sensitivity troponin I: 64 pg/mL; N< 27 pg/mL). The chest X-ray showed an enlarged heart with small pleural effusion on the right side and signs of pulmonary congestion. The initial ECG showed atrial fibrillation with adequate ventricular response rate (70 beats per minute), pseudoinfarction pattern in the inferior (QS complex in DII, DIII, aVF) and anterior (QS complex in V1-V2) leads, a normal (but inconsistent to the hypertrophy revealed by imaging techniques) voltage of the QRS complex and nonspecific ST-T changes (Figure 1).
A transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) (Figure 2) has been performed for grading the severity of the AV disease which revealed a poor opening of the calcified tricuspid AV and a mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation (AR), low transaortic velocities and pressure gradients (peak velocity 2.7 m/s, peak and mean pressure gradients of 30 mmHg and 17 mmHg, respectively) but with a calculated area of 0.8 cm2 (0.46 cm2/m2) confirmed by planimetry at transesophageal echocardiography as 0.7 cm2. The left ventricle (LV) was severely hypertrophied especially in the basal and mid segments (maximum wall thickness of the basal interventricular septum 24 mm) with a normal ejection fraction of 58%, but a small cavity with small end diastolic (66 mL, 38 mL/m2) and end systolic (38mL, 22 mL/m2) volumes resulting in a low stroke volume (SV) (29 mL/m2), leading to a diagnosis of paradoxical low-flow low-gradient severe AS. The patient associated severe longitudinal systolic dysfunction with a GLS of -9.1% and an apical sparing pattern of the bull's eye view rising the suspicion of CA. Other echocardiographic findings on transthoracic echocardiography were the diastolic dysfunction with signs of elevated LV filling pressures (average mitral e' 3 cm/s, E/e' 30.5, LA volume index 59 mL/m2, peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet 3.2 m/s). The right ventricle (RV) free wall was hypertrophied (8 mm) with longitudinal and global systolic dysfunction (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion 9 mm and peak tissue velocity of 7 cm/s, RV fractional area change 32%) and both atria were severely enlarged. A small pericardial effusion was another red flag for CA.
Given the CA suspicion, a whole-body scintigraphy using 99mTc-Hydroxymethylene Diphosphonate (99mTc-HMDP) was performed, which demonstrated important myocardial uptake of the bone tracer highly suggestive of ATTR CA, Perugini grade 3 (Figure 3). The patient also underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (Figure 4) which was consistent with CA: severe biventricular hypertrophy especially in the basal and mid segments of the LV, normal LV global systolic function but with a small cavity, elevated native T1 values (1148 ms) and extracellular volume (58%) measured at 1.5T scanner, abnormal Gadolinium kinetics with simultaneous nulling of both the blood and the myocardium on Look-Locker sequences and global subendocardial with transmural areas of late Gadolinium enhancement, especially in the LV basal and mid segments. Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries without significant atherosclerotic lesions.
The serum and urine light-chain assessment was negative, excluding light-chain amyloidosis and the TTR gene sequencing did not identify any mutation. Therefore, the final diagnosis was ATTRwt CA associated with paradoxical low-flow low-gradient severe degenerative AS.
For this severely symptomatic AS patient, an AV replacement was scheduled choosing the transcatheter approach given the multiple comorbidities and frailty of the patient, according to the current guidelines. The patient successfully underwent a transfemoral TAVR with a 23 mm Edwards Sapien valve, with a well-positioned valve under fluoroscopic and transesophageal echocardiography guidance and a trivial post-procedural paraprosthethic regurgitation. He had no periprocedural complications and he was discharged from the cardiac surgery department without any symptoms at rest. The TTE at 1 month revealed a biological aortic prosthesis with normal aspect and function (Figure 5).
At the 3 months follow-up the patient was experiencing symptoms at minimal efforts, severe fatigability and mild edema. No syncope was reported. We noted low heart rates in the absence of beta-blockers or other bradycardia inducing drugs. The 24h ECG Holter monitoring reported an atrial tachycardia with average heart rate of 52 bpm, lowest heart rate of 25 bpm, longest pause of 3.9 sec and intermittent periods of complete heart block (Figure 6). Given the symptoms and the association of ATTRwt CA, the patient was implanted a single chamber pacemaker (VVI-R). He also received parenteral iron administration due to a severe hyposideremia and a higher dose of diuretics, reporting an improvement in symptomatology in the following months. He was also prescribed long-term treatment with Tafamidis 61 mg per day for the ATTRwt CA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7537991/,13,images/PMC7/PMC753/PMC7537991_01
PMC10405981_01,PMC10405981,Male,44.0,"A 44-year-old male, a non-smoker with no comorbidities, presented to us with complaints of cough for 6 months and fever for 2 months. His Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score was 0. His computed tomography (CT) scan showed a heterogeneous left lower lobe mass 75 mm x 56 mm in size with a few adjacent nodules and a significant adjacent thickened pleura. Histopathology of the lesion was significant for adenocarcinoma grade III, thyroid transcription factor-1 positive [Figure 1].
A positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan revealed a highly active mass in the lower left lobe of the lung, accompanied by lymph node enlargement in the mediastinum and left level IV cervical region [Figure 2]. Based on the AJCC 8th edition guidelines, the final diagnosis was T4N3M0 disease.
The patient was treated with two cycles of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2. Followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy using 55 gray units in 20 fractions [Figure 3] with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on Day 1 and vinorelbine 50 mg/m2 on Day 1, 8 and 15. The patient had a near complete response to treatment and remained on follow-up, with his subsequent scan showing no recurrent disease.
After 8 months of treatment, the patient presented with pain in the right side of the abdomen radiating to the back. CT abdomen was performed, which showed a progressive soft-tissue mass in the paraduodenal (peripancreatic area), inseparable from the uncinate part of the pancreas. Subsequently, endoscopic ultrasound and biopsy of the lesion were conducted, which showed a 46 mm x 31 mm mass involving the duodenum. Histopathology showed metastatic adenocarcinoma from the primary lesion with EGFR mutated at exon 21 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement not detected [Figure 4]. PET-CT showed hypermetabolic activity in the mass [Figure 5].
The patient was treated with palliative radiation therapy using 20 grey units in five fractions for pain control. The pain settled a week after the completion of the radiation therapy. Based on his EGFR mutation, he was started on erlotinib 150 mg once daily (by mouth). There was a significant response to treatment clinically and radiologically. After 6 months, the CT scan revealed disease remission [Figure 6]. The patient reported no grade 2 or 3 side effects, including fatigue and diarrhoea on erlotinib. The patient remains on active follow-up and has been using the medication for the past 2 years.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10405981/,2,images/PMC1/PMC104/PMC10405981_01
PMC4434162_01,PMC4434162,Female,39.0,"A 39-year-old woman (gravida-2, para-2) was presented with menorrhagia and anemia. Preoperative diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging was a 5-cm myoma of the uterus and a 4-cm cystadenoma of the right ovary. Intraoperative findings were significant for an 8-cm uterus and a 4-cm cyst of the right ovary, and total laparoscopic hysterectomy and cystectomy of the right ovary were performed. The anterior wall of the uterus was laparoscopically incised with an ultrasonic scalpel (HARMONIC ACE , Ethicon, United States) to be deformed for vaginal removal. The total weight of the uterus was 190 g. Pathological diagnosis was ESS, formerly referred to as low-grade ESS, and serous cystadenoma of the right ovary. Postoperative thoracic computed tomography (CT) revealed no evidence of lung metastasis; thus, the final diagnosis was ESS stage IA, according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging for uterine sarcomas (2009).
The woman was followed up by a gynecologic oncologist, with vaginal ultrasound examination every 3 months and abdominal and thoracic CT every 6 months. Twenty months after the initial surgery, routine thoracic/abdominal/pelvic CT indicated the presence of multiple lung metastases (5 mm and 4 mm) and the absence of abdominal and pelvic disease, and she underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery. Pathological examination of the partial pneumonectomy confirmed the lung metastases of ESS, and immunohistochemical examination showed positivity for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (Fig. 1). We recommended BSO, to which she agreed after mature consideration, and four months after the thoracic surgery, she underwent laparoscopic exploration and BSO. Intraoperative findings were significant for the disseminations of tumor on the pelvic peritoneum (Fig. 2). Biopsy of the lesions and BSO were performed, but the disseminations persisted. Pathological examination confirmed the peritoneal dissemination of ESS.
Six months after the BSO surgery, laparoscopic exploration for the assessment of castration was performed, which revealed disappearance of peritoneal disseminations (Fig. 3). Thereafter, she has had no evidence of disease for 22 months. She received no hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy throughout the entire course of her disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4434162/,6,images/PMC4/PMC443/PMC4434162_01
