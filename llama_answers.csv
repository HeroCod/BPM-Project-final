"A 41-year-old Indonesian male came to our outpatient clinic due to swelling in fingers and toes for the last nine months. He had limitations in activities of daily living. There was no history of shortening of the digits and joint stiffness in the mornings. Upon physical examination, the patient had leonine facies and madarosis. Hypesthetic hypopigmented macules were found on the right side of the back. (Figure 1) Sensory nerves examination revealed glove and stocking hypesthesia. Fingers and toes were swollen, without redness, warmth, and tenderness on the overlying skin. (Figure 2A) The range of motion was limited in the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers. Claw fingers, drop wrist, muscle atrophy, or contracture of the hands was not detected. Claw toes, drop foot, muscle atrophy, or contracture of the feet was not found. A slit-skin smear showed a bacterial index of 4.38+ (Figure 3) and a morphological index of 79%. We referred the patient to the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatology to perform synovial fluid aspiration from the interphalangeal joint of the hand (Figure 4A). Acid-fast staining of synovial fluid from the interphalangeal joint of the hand revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli (Figure 4B). Histopathological examination on a hypesthetic macule from the back showed epidermal atrophy with Grenz zone. The dermis was minimally infiltrated with lymphocytes and foamy histiocytes, which confirmed the diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy. Radiographic features showed osteolysis and destruction of some phalanges of the hands, bone erosion and destruction of some phalanges of the feet, as well as destruction and subluxation of some hand joints (Figure 2B). These bone changes were concluded as osteomyelitis.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses based on the patient information:  1. Lepromatous Leprosy 2. Neuropathic Osteoarthropathy 3.

"We present the case of a 5 years and 9-month-old female patient, who was admitted in our clinic for inferior limb pain and painful edema of the right index finger. The anamnesis revealed that the patient's mother had complained of joint pain during childhood, and she was diagnosed with acute articular rheumatism. The patient's personal history underlined that she had complained of inferior limb pain for approximately 1 year, but in the last month she associated painful edema of the right index finger, therefore she was referred to a pediatric surgeon, who suspected a proximal interphalangeal subjoint dislocation and requested a hand X-ray. The X-ray showed 2 opaque lesions in the right radial metaphysis, therefore she was admitted in our clinic for further investigations.
The clinical exam performed at the moment of admission revealed the following pathological elements: weight and height deficit, W: 17.6 kg (-0.88 SD), H: 109.5 cm (-1.02 SD), BMI: 14.7 (-0.78 SD), deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the right index finger (Fig. 1), abnormal position of the inferior limbs (genu valgum), and bilateral flat feet.
The laboratory test performed during admission, namely CBC count, transaminases, immunity status (IgA, IgM, and IgG) tests, peripheral smear, but also thyroid hormones, rheumatoid factor, antistreptolysin O titer, anticitrulinated protein antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, circulating immune complexes, parathormone, and serum phosphorus, were all within normal limits. The X-ray of inferior limbs revealed multiple metaphyseal osteochondromas of the distal femur, proximal tibia, and fibula of the 3rd right metatarsal bone, and proximal and medial phalanges of the 2nd, 3rd. and 4th right toes (Fig. 2, 3 and 4).
We also performed a thorax and a spinal column X-ray, but no pathological aspects were identified. We referred the patient to an endocrinologist, but both clinical and ultrasound exams of the thyroid gland were normal. We also requested a genetic consultation, and the genetics specialist suggested a radiological investigation of parents and also periodic radiological assessment of bone lesions with pediatric monitoring.
Based on all these clinical and radiologic findings, we established the diagnosis of multiple osteochondromas.
We assessed both parents radiologically in order to identify a possible hereditary transmission of these bone tumors. The mother X-rays revealed multiple osteochondromas of the left radius, bilateral femur, tibia, and peroneus, and also bilateral metatarsals.

"A 60-year-old male smoker presented with cough, expectoration, and left-sided chest pain for the past one month. Chest radiograph revealed a mass lesion in the left upper lung [Figure 1]. Computed tomography (CT) of thorax revealed a heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the left hemithorax with the involvement of lung and a major portion of posterior mediastinum. Ultrasound-guided FNAC was performed and smears were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E).
Smears were highly cellular with a myxoid background. Cells were ovoid to spindle shaped with relatively uniform nuclei and thin cytoplasm. Focal areas showed a rich capillary network within the myxoid matrix and occasional large atypical cells, both univacuolated and multivacuolated having scalloped nuclei [Figures 2 and 3]. A differential diagnosis of fibrosarcoma was considered initially but ruled out on recognizing lipoblasts and the rich capillary network.","1. Liposarcoma 2. Pulmonary carcinoma 3.

"A 23-year-old man presented with asymptomatic papules on the glans was first noted at the age of 15 that were previously diagnosed as condylomata acuminata (CA) and subsequently treated with topical imiquimod cream for several months but without improvement. He was especially concerned about transmitting the lesions to his sexual partner. Physical examination revealed rows of monomorphic, soft flesh-colored filiform papules confluent over the entire glans with a ""cobblestone"" appearance accompanied by smaller papules in a linear arrangement on the corona (Figure 1). There was no enhancement of the papules with 5% acetic acid. Testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was negative.
Histopathologic examinations of shave biopsy specimens of the papules on the ventral glans demonstrated a polypoidal architecture with hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and focally elongated rete ridges (Figure 2a). The upper dermis featured abundant small vessels with perivascular fibroplasia (Figure 2b). Histologically, the lesions resembled acral angiofibroma.","1. Pearly penile papules 2.

"A 61-year-old unmarried male came with the complaints of right hip pain with the inability to bear weight on the right lower limb for 1 month. There was no history of trauma or other systemic symptoms. He had consulted the local practitioner, who advised an X-ray, which was reported as osteopoikilosis (spotted bone disease) by the radiologist. He was asked to take bed rest and analgesics but the pain persisted.
The patient then visited our tertiary center where the thorough skeletal survey was done, which showed involvement of pelvis (Fig. 1 and 2), spine (Fig. 3), and appendicular skeleton(Fig. 4 and 5) as well. The lesions were osteolytic, small, multiple, of varied sizes involving the whole of the involved bone, rather symmetrically (Fig. 6).
The X-ray with which the patient presented showed superior cortical breach in the femoral neck, but on traction X-ray, the pathological trans-cervical neck femur fracture was noted (Fig. 1). Differential diagnoses considered were metastasis, osteopoikilosis, and multiple myeloma.
Further laboratory investigations were suggestive of high alkaline phosphatase level (1933 U/L) while normal calcium, phosphorus, Vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone level. Further investigation prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was normal, 24h urinary Bence-Jones proteins negative, and bone biopsy shows immune-histochemistry positive for prostatic metastasis. A transurethral biopsy of the prostate came negative while a per-rectal biopsy of the prostate came positive for small cell carcinoma. The bone scan pattern was of super-scan while computed tomography scan showed carcinoma of the prostate with an invasion of the seminal vesicles and extension along the floor and left lateral wall of the urinary bladder leading to urethral obstruction and bilateral hydronephrosis.","1.

"A 65-year-old man had an abnormality (filling defect) of the upper gastrointestinal series in his first medical checkup five years prior. The patient had undergone distal gastrectomy for a gastric ulcer at age forty. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed a 10 mm submucosal tumor-like lesion in the greater curvature of the upper gastric remnant body. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a hypo-echoic tumor located in the third layer. Blood test findings revealed a carcinoembryonic antigen level of 3.8 ng/mL and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level of 6 U/mL, indicating the tumor markers were within the normal range. Because there was no sign of malignancy, the gastric lesion was followed up by annual EGD (Fig. 1). A delle was observed on the top of the tumor five year after the first visit and a biopsy specimen revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2). Contrast computed tomography (CT) showed no nodal or distant metastasis. Laparoscopic gastrectomy and lymph node dissection for remnant gastric cancer was performed. Histological assessment revealed a 28 x 22 mm elevated lesion with a slight depression. Microscopically, papillary adenocarcinoma was observed with a solitary heterotopic gastric gland (sHGG) surrounding by smooth muscle tissues (Fig. 3). Immunohistochemical staining of sHGG, MUC5AC and MUC6 were positive, and MUC1 and MUC2 were negative (Fig. 4). These results revealed the sHGG originated from the stomach. There was smooth muscle tissue around the adenocarcinoma and sHGG was found only in the submucosa. Immunohistochemical staining of the smooth muscle tissues revealed SMA and Vimentin/desmin were positive, S-100a was weak positive, and C-kit/CD34 was negative (data not shown).","1.

"An 80-year-old male, from whom we obtain the consent form, during the follow-up for thymoma (previous thymectomy in 2011) and kidney cancer (previous nephrectomy in 2012), presented a solitary pulmonary nodule in the superior lobe of the right lung as detectable by means of 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan in December 2015 (injected dose 380 MBq). PET/CT images showed a metabolically active lesion (SUVmax 4.63 g/ml bw, 14 mm in diameter), suspected of being a metastasis [Figure 1]. Contrast-enhanced CT with iodinated contrast media performed after PET examination did not show significant attenuation between pre- and postcontrast phase [Figure 2]. After a right pulmonary resection in January 2016, bioptic diagnosis of the nodule was compatible with fibrotic (benign) pulmonary meningioma.
In June 2016, another 18F FDG PET/CT scan was performed in the same patient (injected dose 361 MBq) that showed another new metabolically active pseudonodular lesion (SUVmax 2.46 g/ml bw, 12 mm in diameter) in the superior lobe of the left lung [Figure 3]. A CT scan with iodinated contrast, the lesion showed enhancement at postcontrast phase [basal scan:-1 HU; postcontrast scan: 55 HU, Figure 4]. After an atypical resection of the superior lobe of the left lung in September 2016, biopsy showed a high proliferative activity with a number of mitotic figures >20/10 HPF, Ki-67   20%, with associated necrosis and on immunohistochemistry cells expressed epithelial membrane antigen and they were positive for vimentin and progesterone:","1.

"A 68-year-old man presented to a previous hospital with a diagnosis of acute heart failure. He had undergone prior surgical resection of papillary adenocarcinoma of the thyroid at 3 years before the current presentation. An echocardiogram showed a massive pericardial effusion, and pericardiocentesis was performed. After pericardial drainage, his symptoms, including shortness of breath and dyspnea, were significantly improved. Cytological analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed malignant epithelial cells consistent with the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an anterior mediastinal mass lesion invading the pericardium (Fig. 1A). CT also confirmed swelling of the mediastinal lymph nodes, bilateral pleural effusion, and pleural dissemination (Fig. 1B). He was therefore referred to our hospital with suspicious mediastinal metastasis of primary unknown malignancy. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was 69.2 ng/ml. A review of organ systems revealed a liver lesion, suggesting liver metastasis. However, no other suspicious primary lesions were found. For histological confirmation, a video-assisted thoracoscopic tumor biopsy was performed. In addition to an incisional biopsy of the mediastinal tumor, a biopsy of the lung pleural nodule was also performed.
Microscopic examination of both tumors showed that cuboidal cancer cells with mucin production proliferated in a fused glandular or small-nested pattern. Extracellular mucin pools and signet-ring-like cells were also noted (Fig. 2). These histological features were not similar to those of thyroid papillary adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, cancer cells are positive for cytokeratin (CK) 20 and caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX-2), and negative for CK7, estrogen receptor, CD5, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) (Fig. 3).","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1.

"A 51-year-old female was admitted on May 9, 1995, because of severe hematemesis. The patient had been treated elsewhere for one month for pain and redness of both breasts and fever (>= 38 C). There was no generalized lymphadenopathy. On gastroscopic examination multiple small ulcers were observed in the stomach. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan showed liver tumor and a normal spleen. Hematological and biochemical examination at admission showed the following results: RBC 352 x 104/mm3, hemoglobin 10.3 g/dl (post transfusion), WBC 4,900/mm3, Platelets 51,000/mm3, serum albumin 1.5 g/dl, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl, AST 691 IU/l, ALT 187 IU/l, LDH 2976 IU/l, fibrinogen 134 mg/dl, FDP 10 mug/ml, and AT-III 40%. Bleeding from the stomach continued and did not stop with conservative treatment; therefore, two days later the patient underwent total gastrectomy and a partial liver resection. Histopathology of the resected specimen showed it to be a gastric lymphoma (pleomorphic medium-large cell type, non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma) with liver metastasis (Fig. 1). From first postoperative day (POD), bleeding from the esophagojejunostomy continued; the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and died on 8th postoperative day.
On autopsy, malignant lymphoid cell infiltration and hemophagocytosis were observed in the liver, spleen, heart, small bowel, lung, both breasts, kidney, pancreas, uterus, and gastroduodenal lymph nodes (Fig. 2). The bone marrow presented hyperplasia and hemophagocytic macrophages but no infiltration by lymphoma cells. Immunohistochemically the neoplastic cells were positive for T-cell marker UCHL1 (CD45RO) and EBV by EBER in situ hybridization.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1.

"A 75-year-old man was referred for abdominal computed tomography (CT) due to a poorly defined liver mass, detected by the primary care physician on ultrasound screening, which turned out to be a hemangioma. As an accidental finding, the contrast-enhanced CT scan additionally showed an 8 x 11 x 15 cm large retroperitoneal mass in the lower left abdomen adjacent to the sigmoid colon and the left psoas muscle (Figure 1A). The density measurements revealed that the thinly encapsulated mass consisted predominantly of fat with a few solid nodular structures. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the lesion to be composed predominantly of fat with a few solid hypervascularized nodules (Figure 1B and C). The mass was palpable through the abdominal wall but painless. Laboratory findings indicated a mild anemia (hemoglobin 12.9 g/dl) but were otherwise unremarkable. The patient had no history of malignant or infectious disease.
Due to the imaging findings, a retroperitoneal liposarcoma was suspected and the patient underwent surgery with resection of the mass and the adjacent sigmoid colon. Intraoperatively, the tumor showed firm adhesions both with the mesentery of the sigmoid colon as well as with the adjacent small bowel mesentery. During adhesiolysis, several tumor feeding vessel originating from the inferior mesenteric artery were identified and clamped. Due to the close proximity of the tumor to the sigmoid colon, the latter was resected en bloc together with the mass and a side-to-side descendo-rectostomy was performed. Macroscopic appearance as well as histology and immunohistochemistry of the mass are shown in Figure 2.
Macroscopic evaluation of the surgical specimen confirmed the predominance of fat within the thinly encapsulated tumor (Figure 2A). Histology demonstrated the presence of large-sized lipid vacuoles and small, disseminated islands of lipoblasts (Figure 2B). Variable-sized nests of epitheloid cells were spread over the tumor. Immunohistochemically, these cells showed only weak staining for melan-A, desmin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) (Figure 2C). S-100 staining was negative but strong reaction was found for human melanoma black HMB-45 (Figure 2D). MiB1 staining revealed a proliferation rate < 1% and no mitoses were observed. A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MDM2 gene amplification was negative, thus a liposarcoma was ruled out and","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1.

"Our second patient is a 62-year-old female who presented with a slowly enlarging left supraorbital swelling. CT and MRI imaging showed a T1-enhancing, T2 hypointense mass in the left frontal sinus with hyperostotic bone formation that had eroded through the adjacent bone of the posterior table, contacted the dura, and pushed the frontal lobe posteriorly. It also extended inferiorly into the ethmoids, eroded the lamina papyracea, contacted the left medial rectus, and eroded the superior orbital wall (Fig. 3). She underwent an endoscopic biopsy that showed LGSSNMF and then underwent a craniofacial resection of the anterior skull base in combination with neurosurgery. Final pathology showed a tumor focally eroding the bone comprising monotonous spindle cells without cytological atypia that were positive for S100 and SMA, and negative for desmin, myf4, and the SYT gene translocation.","1.

"The patient was a 31-year-old male with a six-year history of left inguinoscrotal swelling, which had been gradually increasing in size for the past three years. The size of the swelling showed no association with increased intraperitoneal pressure. Physical examination revealed no evident defects in the appearance of the scrotum, with the exception of several hard, botryoidal masses, located between the left testicle and the inguinal region, with smooth surfaces and limited capacity of mobility. Ultrasound examination revealed several solid, well-demarcated, hypoechoic extratesticular masses arising from the left spermatic cord, the largest of which was ~3 x 2 cm in size. The masses were separated from the cutis and showed no connections with the left testis and epididymis, and no vascularity was observed. The patient's family signed an informed consent prior to the treatment.
A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple high-density nodules associated with the left spermatic cord, which showed partial fusion, uniform density and a clear boundary with the testis (Fig. 1). In addition, the density of the nodules was enhanced slightly and no bilateral inguinal swollen lymph nodes were observed in the enhanced scan.
The masses were removed by a left spermatic cord tumor resection via a left inguinal approach, under epidural anesthesia. Benign mesenchymal tissue was diagnosed by intraoperative frozen pathological sections. Postoperative pathological examination confirmed that the masses belonged to multiple mesenchymal tumors with classic properties, including fibroplasia, small vascular hyalinization, clear boundaries, less tumor component and no nuclear division. Immunohistochemical examination revealed the presence of numerous tumor markers, including CD99+, Bcl-2+, partial CD34+, focal S-100+, SMA+ and CD68- (Fig. 2). Thus,","1. Benign Mesenchymal Tumor 2.

"A 23-year-old male patient presented with the early satiety, pain in the abdomen, and weight loss (5-6 kg) for the past 4 months. Ultrasonography (USG) abdomen showed large right suprarenal mass (9.5 cm x 8.8 cm x 12.5 cm) for which endocrinology referral was sought. The patient underwent multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) which includes unenhanced, early arterial (20 s), early venous (60 s), and delayed (15 min) phases. CECT [Figure 1] showed rounded right suprarenal mass with central areas of necrosis and had a size of 9.9 cm (maximum size on axial images). Mass showed heterogeneous contrast enhancement, and it showed bright enhancement in arterial phase (Hounsfield unit [HU]-158.2) with good washout (Absolute washout percentage - 70.1%). On biochemical evaluation, plasma metanephrines (44.1 pg/ml, normal range <180 pg/ml) and normetanephrines (30.4 pg/ml, normal range <180 pg/ml) were normal ruling out secretory pheochromocytoma. I131 metaiodobenzylguanidine scan was done to rule out the possibility of nonsecretory pheochromocytoma, which showed no significant uptake in the mass. On morning 8 am cortisol (13.85 mug/dl, normal range <30 mug/dl) and overnight dexamethasone suppression cortisol (0.8 mug/dl, normal range <1.8 mug/dl) ruled out the secretory adrenal cortical carcinoma. 18-flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) revealed [Figure 2] multiple hypermetabolic lesions at right adrenal mass (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax]: 4.52), lytic lesion in the left scapula (SUVmax: 4.46), and soft tissue mass (7.3 cm) noted in the left gluteal region eroding the left iliac bone, acetabulum, inferior pubic rami and possibly invading the hip joint (SUVmax-5.5). USG-guided biopsy from the adrenal and gluteal region was done. Both biopsy cores showed tumor cells arranged as nests separated by thin vascular septae. Cells were discohesive with central round nucleus and moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm on microscopy [Figure 3a]. On immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were positivity for TFE [Figure 3b] and epithelial membrane antigen (focal) and were negative for cytokeratin, synaptophysin, inhibin, melan-A, and PAX8 diagnostic of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS).","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1.

"A 62-year-old female was admitted to our Emergency Department with a chief complaint of left lower quadrant abdominal pain. The patient also complained of not having had bowel movements for several days before coming to the hospital. She had a history of hypertension controlled with medication she did not smoke and had no previous surgical or hospitalization history.
A mass was palpable in the lower left quadrant. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a poly-lobulated mass in the left abdomen emanating from the left colon (Fig. 1). Small to moderate pockets of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis were observed. Moderate-to-large amount of stool in the proximal colon suggested constipation and partial obstruction (Fig. 1). However, there was no significant bowel dilatation.
Colonoscopy revealed an obstructing tumor in the descending colon. During colonoscopy, superficial biopsies were taken which showed villous adenoma on top of the tumor. The patient was taken to the operating theater and underwent a left hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis of the colon without diverting ostomy. Upon surgical intervention, the tumor extended through the colon wall with pericolonic hemorrhage (Fig. 2) arising from the mesocolon. The pathologic evaluation revealed extension of the tumor with metastasis to local lymph nodes and with hemorrhage. The mass measured 7 cm in greatest dimension which on section was nodular and brown (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Tumor markers were elevated, including: cancer antigen 125 (CA125) at 165 (0-32 mg/ml). Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) was also elevated at 48 (0-31 U/ml). Postoperatively the patient did well, diet was advanced and she was discharged five days later. Two weeks later in the office visit, she was doing well.
Microscopically, the tumor was composed of cells with small nuclei and scant cytoplasm, having the appearance of lymphocytes. They were arranged in large packets - separated by fine fibrovascular septa, so there is an organoid architecture, but it is very subtle. Nuclear molding was not observed. A CD45 (lymphocyte common antigen) IHC stain was negative. There were also nests of cells with a squamous appearance with keratin pearl formation. The proliferation marker Ki-67 was stained and was almost 100% (Fig. 3). The squamous cells were positive for cytokeratin marker 5/6 (CK5/6), P40 marker and P63 marker (Fig. 4). These markers confirm squamous cell differentiation. Interestingly they were also positive for CDX2 staining (Fig. 4), which indicates these cells have intestinal differentiation. The lymph node metastases showed similar features to that in the colonic mass with both neuroendocrine and squamous cell features.","1. Colorectal adenocarcinoma 2. Villous adenoma 3.

"A 16-year-old male presented to the clinic with a 2-week history of intermittent headaches. There were no localizing signs or motor or sensory symptoms. The past history was significant only for known multiple enchondromatosis, which had been diagnosed at 15 years of age after a pathological fracture of the proximal phalanx of his right index finger. The lesions had been localized to the index and middle fingers of right hand in a ray distribution [Figure 1].
We obtained a noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan [Figure 2], which showed a nonspecific hypodense lesion in the right insular cortex. There was no hemorrhage, calcification, or significant perilesional edema. The patient was subsequently lost to follow-up and no further investigations could be performed at that point. Three years later, however, the patient was admitted following a road traffic accident. Noncontrast CT scan [Figure 3] was done and showed a subdural hematoma (SDH) over the left cerebral convexity. The previously identified lesion in the right insular cortex had increased in size. In addition, there were similar hypodense lesions in the left basifrontal region and the left precentral gyrus.
The patient underwent an emergency craniotomy for the SDH. A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) done 1 week later [Figure 4] showed an additional smaller lesion in the right cingulate gyrus. None of these lesions showed contrast enhancement. The possibility of multifocal gliomas was raised. The patient subsequently underwent biopsy of the left high frontal lesion. The initial pathology report, based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, showed mild focal increase in cellularity within the sampled tissue [Figure 5]. There was no conclusive evidence of a glioma. Immunohistochemical staining for mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) was subsequently performed and came back positive in the areas of increased cellularity.","Oligodendroglioma Diffuse astrocytoma Ganglioglioma Enchondromatosis-related glioma Pilocytic astrocytoma"
"This case was a 70-year-old patient who had a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), symptomatic of dyspnea and congestive heart failure. At that time, his AF was converted by electrical cardioversion with resolution of his symptoms. A year later, he presented with several months' history of progressive and marked dyspnea with minimal exertion. He underwent regadenoson MPI for cardiac evaluation. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm, first degree atrioventricular (AV) block, and T wave inversion in the inferolateral leads suggestive of myocardial ischemia (Figure 1). His MPI demonstrated mildly decreased LV ejection fraction of 49% without evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction; however, significant LV calcification (Figure 2) was observed on the low-dose CT used for attenuation correction during MPI.
Subsequently, other imaging studies, including chest x-ray, echocardiography, and chest CT, were obtained for further evaluation. The chest x-ray (Figure 3) showed extensive cardiac calcification, and the echocardiogram (Figure 4) revealed significant calcification of mitral valve annulus, LV septum, and mid free wall. However, his chest CT (Figure 5) revealed massive myocardial calcification involving only LV and its overlaying pericardium.
The patient had no past history of malignancy, endocrine disorder, tuberculosis, or recent traveling to other countries. Extensive laboratory evaluation revealed elevated NT-proB-type Natriuertic Peptide (1113.5 pg/ml; normal < 100 pg/ml) and C-reactive protein (1.21 mg/ dL, normal < 0.5 mg/dL), but normal findings of complete blood count, basic chemistry profile, troponin-I, sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody, antimitochondrial antibody, serum calcium/phosphate level, vitamin D level, and thyroid and parathyroid hormone levels. His echocardiography showed: (1) normal LV systolic function with calcification in the LV septum, mid free wall and mitral valve annulus (Figure 4) and normal right ventricular (RV) size and systolic function; (2) moderate bi-atrial enlargement with mild mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation; and (3) severe pulmonary hypertension and LV diastolic dysfunction. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated: (1) no angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease; (2) moderately severe pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 67 mmHg; (3) elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, measured at 28 mmHg; (4) elevated LV end-diastolic pressure, measured 29 mmHg; and (5) no evidence of ventricular interdependence on simultaneous LV/RV pressure measurement.","1.

"A 73-year-old Chinese male patient presented with a 6-month history of pruritic papules on the bilateral groin. The most potent steroid and antifungal ointments did not improve the eruptions before he sought evaluation at our hospital. The medical history was significant for a cerebral infarction. There was no family history of similar complaints. The dermatologic examination revealed multiple gray-white or dark red hyperkeratotic papules on a brown background on the bilateral groin. On closer examination, the hyperkeratotic papules had a verrucous appearance, some of which had coalesced. The papules were slightly hard on palpation (Figure 1). There were no abnormalities involving the axillae or perianal folds.
The possible diagnosis included viral warts, seborrheic keratoses, Bowenoid papulosis, Hailey-Hailey disease, Darier disease, confluent and reticulated papillomatosis, granular parakeratosis, and Langerhans histiocytosis. A skin biopsy was performed and revealed the following: the stratum corneum showed highly compact hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis with basophilic granules; the epidermis showed obvious acanthosis with psoriasiform hyperplasia; and lymphocytes infiltrated around small vessels in the upper dermis (Figure 2).

Physical examination revealed right paresis and global aphasia. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 13 out of 42. CTA and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images showed acute cerebral infarction due to left middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Endovascular thrombectomy was performed and subsequent imaging showed successful revascularization (Fig. 1). Postoperative MRI showed diffuse infarction of the left hemisphere. Since the embolic source was unknown, the patient was kept under 24-hour monitor surveillance, had a Holter electrocardiogram (ECG), and underwent transthoracic echocardiogram, but no cardiogenic embolic source was revealed. The entire aorta was normal and showed no atherosclerotic change on CTA imaging. TEE revealed a pedunculate tumor-like lesion on the proximal ascending aorta (Fig. 2). The lesion was highly mobile and approximately 7 mm in size. Cardiac CT showed a corresponding contrast medium filling defect (Fig. 3). This finding was not detected on the CTA taken 2 days before. AMT was suspected, and surgical removal was planned 1 month after hospitalization. We started anti- coagulant therapy with heparin followed by bridging therapy with warfarin (controlled within 2.0-3.0 international normalized ratio). Follow-up TEE was performed 3 weeks after admission, and showed complete resolution of the thrombus (Fig. 4). During this period, there was no sign of symptomatic embolism. Cardiac CT was also performed and revealed the same result. An additional CTA was performed to rule out peripheral embolism, but there were no signs of occluded arteries.

"A 30-year-old Albanian female patient was referred to our hospital for living donor kidney transplantation. She was unable to walk without help and was restricted to a wheelchair. Her medical history included chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, anemia, and hepatitis C. She had been undergoing dialysis three times per week for 19 years. A tumor was protruding through her oral cavity; it had appeared insidiously 10 years ago and had increased gradually in size. The lesion was fixed to the underlying mandible, was tender to the touch, and was covered with oral mucosa. The teeth were severely affected, and bleeding sites were observed on the fragile mucosa (fig. 1). The patient had functional problems with chewing and speech. Serum chemistry revealed an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 2,930.6 pg/dl (normal range, 15-65 pg/dl), serum calcium 9.08 mg/dl (normal range, 8.8-11 mg/dl), phosphorus 4.2 mg/dl (normal range, 2.5-5.0 mg/dl), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 1,753 IU/l (normal range, 65-300 IU/l).
A sagittal magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head showed a brown tumor originating from the mandibular and maxillary bones (fig. 2). Ultrasonography of the neck revealed no parathyroid mass; however, a scan with 20 mCi Tc-99-sestamibi showed increased uptake by the parathyroid glands (fig. 3).

"Case 3 was a 65-year-old Indian man with symptoms of hematochesza, anorexia for 5 months, epigastric pain, a lump in the epigastrium, and loose stools for 2-3 months. He underwent total colectomy and the specimen showed the presence of a collision tumor on histological examination.
Gross pathological examination showed an ulceroproliferative growth measuring 7.6 cm in the transverse colon. This was a mucinous tumor containing irregular glands lined by mucinous epithelium with large areas of extracellular mucin material consistent with adenocarcinoma, with an adjacent area showing monomorphic cells in solid nests, consistent histopathologically with a diagnosis of carcinoid tumor (Figure 6). Immunohistochemistry showed the carcinoid area to be chromogranin-positive (Figure 7).","1. Collision tumor 2. Adenocarcinoma 3. Carcinoid tumor 4. Colorectal cancer 5. Mucinous adenocarcinoma"
"A 4-year-old male toddler presented to our hospital due to the elevated serum HCG levels, produced by the tumor. On examination, the muscle strength of the lower limbs was grade 4 and the skin of the whole body was hairy, with a beard and pubic hair. The development of external genitalia was significantly larger than the boys of the same age. An irregular cafe-au-lait macule could be seen on the right forehead, which might be considered as a sign of the syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed a space-occupying lesion in the right lateral ventricle with hydrocephalus ( Figures 1A - C ). Increasing levels of beta-hCG (207.72 U/L:NV 0-5) were found in serum. The patient had epiphyseal dysplasia of the lower limbs with a slight limp in the right lower limb. The patient underwent space-occupying resection of the lesions and external ventricular drain ( Figures 1D - F ). Microscopical analysis indicated that the tumor was a malignant tumor of germ cell origin without any nongerminomas germ cell tumors components ( Figure 1J ). Immunochemistry was performed and showed AFP/HCG negative and PLAP/CD117 positive by postoperative tissue, and probably the HCG-producing trophoblastic giant cells have been missed. The Ki67 proliferation index of hot spots was high (50%-60%). After surgery, acne improved and beta-hCG returned to normal levels. Combined with histological morphology and immunohistochemistry,","1.

"A 68-year-old man was admitted with a 3 months history of cough, sputum production, dyspnea, hemoptysis, chest pain, and weight loss. Physical examination found a patient cachectic with a mass of right chest wall pain on palpation. The chest radiography demonstrated bilateral mass lesion (Figure 1) and thoracal CT showed mass lesion in left lung with parietal invasion (Figure 2) and in right lower lobe (Figure 3). Complete blood count showed anemia (Hb:9.7mg/dl). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 94 mm/hr. Bronchoscopic examination revealed a large polypoidal tumor arising from the left lower lobe bronchus, histology at bronchial biopsy revealed a malignant melanoma :the cytoplasm of the tumor cells contained granular, brown pigment compatible with melanin, the tumor extended to the bronchial epithelium. Immunohistochemical stains were strongly positive for antibodies to S-100 protein and humain melanoma black-45 which confirmed the diagnosis. Surgical biopsy of the left parietal mass was confirmed by invasive malignant melanoma.
To exclude the possibility of metastasis from occult primary malignant melanoma, an extensive examination was carried out, the patient had no past history of skin tumor, and we could not find any skin, external ear, or ocular lesions. Gastrointestinal endoscopy, colonoscopy, and endoscopy of the nasal cavity were performed, and no possible primary tumor was detected.","1. Malignant Melanoma 2. Primary Lung Cancer 3.

"The first electromyography (EMG) (2005) showed a myopathic pattern in the lower limbs from which a muscle biopsy was requested but the patient postponed it. Until the patient was 20 years old, her symptoms were progressive; then, she experienced a stabilization of the disease. A biopsy taken in 2011 revealed dystrophic changes (degeneration/ regeneration) with markedly increased endomysial connective tissue; no inflammatory cell infiltration, ragged red fiber, cytoplasmic body and lipid or glycogen accumulation in muscle fibers were seen (fig.1). An immunohistochemistry (IHC) study of sarcolemmal proteins showed sarcolemma labeling of all fibers with DYS1, DYS2, DYS3, alpha and gamma sarcoglycan, dysferlin, merosin, and beta-spectrin (fig.2). 
The second EMG in 2011 showed a myopathic process pronounced in the proximal muscles. With a diagnosis of LGMD, rehabilitation, physical therapy, and stretching exercises were advised to improve her mobility and prevent disused atrophy or contracture deformities. In April 2015, she complained of acute left visual loss for four days with painful eye movements that lasted for several days. Her muscle strength had not changed for 5 years. On examination of her pupils, the left one had 2+ relative afferent pupillary defects (RAPD). Left visual acuity was finger counting from one meter with cecocentral scotoma in the visual field. Extraocular muscles and other cranial nerves were intact. Ophthalmologic consultation revealed no bulbar ophthalmic problems. For further evaluation, we planned a brain and optic pathway MRI that excluded compressive lesions of the optic pathway and disclosed multiple periventricular, centrum semiovale, corpus callosum, juxta cortical, and infra tentorial (brain stem and cerebellum) T2 hypersignal demyelinating plaques with multiple lesion enhancement (fig 3) that fulfilled the McDonald criteria for MS.
From this, we prescribed intravenous methyl prednisolone (5 gr divided in 5 days) for the treatment of her optic neuritis. She responded significantly and her visual acuity ameliorated so that she could read from 30 cm. Vasculitis tests and anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies were negative.","1.

"A 34-year-old Nigerian woman presented to the ED with a chief complaint of dyspnea, cough, and fever for two days. The patient also complained of epigastric pain and intermittent emesis. She denied any significant prior medical or surgical history.
Physical exam revealed a toxic-appearing female in respiratory distress. Vital signs were temperature 100.5 F; blood pressure 103/76mmHg; heart rate 126bpm; respiratory rate 32bpm; and 99% oxygen saturation on room air. She had decreased breath sounds on the right side, and exhibited right upper quadrant tenderness on palpation. The cardiovascular exam was remarkable only for the tachycardia.
A portable chest radiograph (CXR) revealed complete atelectasis of the right lung with adjacent large right pleural effusion, causing mediastinal shift to the left, consistent with tension hydrothorax (Figure 1). A computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest confirmed the above findings; there was no evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection (Figure 2). An ultrasound-guided thoracentesis removed 1.5L of serosanguinous fluid. The patient reported relief of chest pain and dyspnea after the thoracentesis.
The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated for presumed pneumonia and sepsis with broad spectrum antibiotics. A purified protein derivative for tuberculosis was negative. She had a chest tube placed on hospital day 2 for recurrent right pleural effusion, with return of two liters of serosanguinous fluid. Pleural fluid cultures, acid fast bacteria (AFB) and cytology were all negative.
Because of worsening abdominal pain and distention, on hospital day 4 a CT of the abdomen/pelvis was ordered and revealed a pelvic mass of unclear uterine or adnexal etiology, with abdominal implants and ascites, suspicious for malignancy. A follow-up pelvic ultrasound was less suggestive of malignancy, and revealed two solid uterine lesions and an enlarged right ovary with cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral complex cystic adnexal structures with hemorrhage; a tubo-ovarian abscess was suspected.
On hospital day 14, the patient underwent laparoscopy with biopsy. Laparoscopy revealed blue-tinged lesions on the central omentum, a nodular omental lesion, and pelvic wall nodule. The peritoneum was described as having a fibrinous exudate with mucinous appearance along the surface. Biopsies of the omental and pelvic nodules confirmed the lesions to be consistent with endometriosis and a pelvic wall abscess.","1. Endometriosis 2. Tension hydrothorax 3. Tubo-ovarian abscess 4.

"A 72-year-old-woman was admitted to our hospital with a 6 x 4.5 cm huge tumor in which an artery was penetrating in the pancreatic tail (Fig. 1A, white arrows). She had a history of hypertension, spinal canal stenosis, and inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome. She had no abdominal symptoms; however, survey for malignancy helped detect the tumor incidentally. Laboratory data revealed a low white blood cell count of 2440/muL (normal range [NR]: 3300-8600) and low sodium level (133 mEq/dL, NR: 138-145). The following tumor markers were all within the respective NRs: carcinoembryonic antigen (4.1 ng/mL, NR:  5.8); carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (12 U/mL, NR:  37); duke pancreatic antigen type 2 (<25 U/mL, NR:  150); and s-pancreas antigen-1 (8.5 U/mL, NR:  30). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed calcification at the edge of the tumor (Fig. 1B, C), no cystic lesion, and gradual enhancement. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed hypointensity of the tumor on T1-weighted images (Fig. 1D) and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (Fig. 1E). EUS revealed the tumor had a clear boundary with a low echoic mass. We suspected that it was a neuroendocrine tumor, acinar cell carcinoma, solitary-pseudopapillary neoplasm, schwannoma, or anaplastic ductal carcinoma based on the calcification, gradual enhancement, and expansive growth. Therefore, EUS-FNA was performed (Fig. 2A), and spindle-shaped cells (Fig. 2B, C) that were immunopositive for S-100 (Fig. 2D) and negative for c-kit, CD34, and desmin were detected. Therefore,","1.

"A 69-year-old man presented with a one month history of swelling of the left lower extremity. He had no specific past medical history and no history of trauma. No other abnormality was found on physical examination and we suspected that he suffered with deep vein thrombosis. Ultrasonography showed a cystic mass containing hypoechoic materials attached to the left common femoral vein (Fig. 1A). For further evaluation, we performed CT venography using 64 channel multi-detector computed tomography (Aquilion, Toshiba, Japan) with the patient in the supine position. A 22-gauge intravenous cannula was placed in the dorsal vein of the left foot, and a tourniquet was placed around the left knee. Forty milliliters of a contrast medium diluted with 60 milliliters of saline was automatically injected via a Y adapter into the left leg at a rate of 3 cc/sec. The optimal scan delay for the venous phase was determined by use of bolus tracking at the left popliteal vein. The axial and coronal reconstruction images showed a 1.7 cm sized cystic mass compressing the left common femoral vein along with dilated medial circumflex femoral and obturator veins that provided collateral circulation for the occluded left common femoral vein (Fig. 1B, C). A 3D volume rendering image showed an abrupt tapered disconnection of the left common femoral vein along with the formation of multiple collateral vessels (Fig. 1D). The patient underwent an operation because of his swollen leg. Surgical exploration showed an approximately 1.5 cm sized cystic mass over the anterior surface of the left common femoral vein. A longitudinal venostomy was performed at this location and a gelatinous material exuded from the mass and this gelatinous material could also be aspirated from the mass. A 10-cm long segment of the left common femoral vein/distal iliac vein was resected and a Gore-Tex graft was interposed. Microscopically, a cystic widened adventitial layer of the vein showed adventitial hemorrhage, fibrin deposition and focal aggregation of foamy histiocytes and focal myxoid degeneration (Fig. 1E, F). CT venography was performed again after the operation for a follow up evaluation. The cystic mass in the left inguinal areas was gone, as were the multiple collateral vessels (Fig. 1G).","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Venous Malformation 2.

"A 59-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with intermittent upper abdominal pain. He had a history of cervical disc herniation, lumbar compression fracture and abdominal aortic aneurysm. Physical examination revealed slight tenderness in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, and no masses were palpable. Laboratory data on admission showed: erythrocyte count 411 x 104/mm3 (normal 410-530), hemoglobin 13.7 g/dl (normal 14-18), leukocyte count 9,800/mm3 (normal 4,000-8,000), platelet count 27.1 x 104/mm3 (normal 15-40), serum total protein 6.8 g/dl (normal 6.5-8.0), total bilirubin 0.67 mg/dl (normal 0.2-1.0), aspartate aminotransferase 16 IU/l (normal 10-40), alanine aminotransferase 12 IU/l (normal 5-40), alkaline phosphatase 339 IU/l (normal 115-360), lactate dehydrogenase 256 IU/l (normal 119-229), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase 56 IU/l (normal 10-47), serum amylase 100 U/l (normal 33-116), blood urea nitrogen 14.0 mg/dl (normal 8-22), creatinine 0.8 mg/dl (normal 0.6-1.1), and C-reactive protein 1.71 mg/dl (normal 0-0.3). The serum level of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was slightly elevated to 6.5 ng/ml (normal 0-5), and the carbohydrate antigen (CA19-9) level was elevated to 159.3 U/ml (normal 0-37).
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed numerous strongly enhanced abnormal vessels and a hypovascular lesion in the area of the pancreatic tail (fig. 1a). Angiographic study of the celiac artery confirmed racemose vascular networks in the tail of the pancreas and early venous return to the portal system (fig. 1b). Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) revealed narrowing and displacement of the main pancreatic duct in the tail of the pancreas (fig. 1c). Screening esophagoscopy showed a 0-IIa+IIc type tumor in the lower thoracic esophagus and multiple Lugol-voiding lesions. Histological examination of esophagoscopic biopsies showed squamous cell carcinoma.
Based on these findings, P-AVM and chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer with esophageal cancer were diagnosed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy and distal pancreatectomy with partial transverse colectomy were performed. The operative time was 402 min, and the amount of blood loss was 956 ml. There was a honeycomb-like structure with collected vessels in the pancreas. The splenic vein was occupied by thrombi (fig. 2).
Histological examination of the resected pancreas revealed rupture of the dilated pancreatic duct with bleeding (fig. 3a), pancreatic stones (fig. 3b) and severe atrophy with fibrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma (fig. 3c). These findings were consistent with chronic pancreatitis. In addition, many abnormal vessels, some containing thrombi, were observed in the pancreas (fig. 3d).","1.

"A 35-year-old man with painless gross hematuria with left flank pain of two-month duration was admitted to our hospital on April 12, 2001. He gave no history of B symptoms and did not have a significant medical history. There was no enlargement of the liver, spleen or lymph nodes. Evaluation at that time included normal findings on chest X-ray films, serum chemistry, complete blood count and serum protein electrophoresis, except slightly elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and increased lactate dehydrogenase. To evaluate gross hematuria, intravenous pyelography (IVP) and cystoscopy were performed. IVP showed a lobulated filling defect on the left wall of the urinary bladder associated with left hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Cystoscopy revealed an edematous walnut sized and broad-based mass on the left ureteral orifice and bladder neck. Histological examination of the biopsy taken transurethrally from two parts of the bladder mucosa and urethra showed malignant lymphoma (Figure 1A). Immunohistochemical study showed positive reaction for the monoclonal antibody marking B-lymphocytes (Figure 1B). For stage evaluation, chest CT, abdomino-pelvic CT and bone marrow biopsy were performed. Chest CT scan showed no visible lymph node or mass. Abdomino-pelvic CT scan demonstrated left side hydronephrois and hydroureter with left proximal ureter infiltration and thickening of the left lateral wall of the bladder with perivesical fat infiltration without lymph node enlargement (Figure 2A, 2B). Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed normocellular marrow with diffuse infiltration of lymphoid cells (Figure 3). The beta2-microglobin level was 3.4 mg/L.","1. Primary bladder lymphoma 2.

"Two months before the patient visited our hospital she had been admitted to the emergency unit of another hospital with vomiting, abdominal pain and weight loss of 10 kg within three months. A diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was ruled out. Her clinical signs were initially attributed to severe gastritis and an ulcer in the pyloric canal. She had suffered from primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) since 1992 and had been treated with 750 mg of ursodeoxycholic acid daily without immunosuppressive therapy. She had no significant past history of pulmonary or genital tuberculosis. She had given birth to a son and a daughter.
Physical examination showed a blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg; regular pulse at 84/min; and a body temperature of 39.6 C. Superficial lymph nodes were not palpable. Chest examination revealed basal breathing. The patient's abdomen was distended, and peristaltic sounds were not audible. Edema of the extremities was present. The initial laboratory data for blood (Table 1) rendered a high C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 15.68 mg/dl. Her tuberculin test was negative.
CT scan of the chest showed bilateral pleural effusions without lymph node swellings. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed massive ascites with multiple septa. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a thickened intestinal wall located in the sigmoid colon (Fig. 1) and pronounced enhancement of the peritoneum. There were no masses or lymph node swellings in the abdominal cavity. Esophagogastroscopy and ileocoloscopy revealed no ulcer or stenosis in the colon or ileum.
The nature of ascites was revealed by puncture and findings are listed in Table 2, including a protein level of 4.6 g/dl. Microscopy was requested for malignant cells and Mycobacterium, neither of which was discovered. The cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of stool and urine as well as from bronchial lavage were negative for M. tuberculosis, but the culture of ascites returned positive for M. tuberculosis after three weeks.","1.

"An 85-year-old man visited our hospital because of persistent fever and pain. He had a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the left upper and lower lobes, metastasis to the ipsilateral lung and femur, home oxygen therapy, etc. He was followed-up for the lung cancer at another hospital. At the time of admission, there was right lower abdominal pain. Blood test findings showed high inflammation, normal range of tumor marker levels obtained CEA, ProGRP, and CYFRA. Chest-abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an existing squamous cell carcinoma in the left upper and lower lobes (Fig. 1). The appendix was swollen, with a maximum diameter of about 20 mm, with an increased concentration of surrounding fat tissue, a finding of acute appendicitis. Nodules were found near the cecum, mesentery, peripancreatic area, dorsal side of the left kidney, etc., and were considered to be metastases or dissemination (Fig. 2). Because of his advanced age, history of many previous illnesses, and the fact that he did not want emergency surgery, he was followed-up with conservative treatment. He was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with antibiotics was started. Two days later, he vomited and the blood test showed relapse of inflammation. It was getting worse even in CT, emergency surgery was performed with the consent of the patient.
A midline incision was placed about 10 cm above and below the navel. A perforation was confirmed in the middle of the appendix, and an abscess had formed around the appendix. A white nodular structure near the cecum was considered to be the cause of the perforated appendicitis. The abscess wall and the small intestine were adhered to each other. No nodules were found on the abdominal wall or pelvic floor, but white nodules were also scattered in the mesentery. Cecal resection was performed, the operation time was 83 min, and the blood loss was 98 g.
Examination of the resected specimen showed that the appendix was thickened overall, with a white nodular structure at the root and a perforation in the middle (Fig. 3). Histopathologically (Fig. 4), atypical cells formed large and small tumor vesicles in the thickened appendix wall, and the tumor cells proliferated invasively, centering on the proper muscle layer.

"The patient was a 74-year-old woman who found a giant mass in the mediastinum during a routine examination before surgery on her right breast lesion (ductal carcinoma in situ). The mediastinal lesion resection was performed one month after breast surgery (February 2022). The patient had no cough, expectoration, dyspnea, chest tightness, or chest pain before the operation. No MG or other related symptoms were evident. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a giant mass located in the anterior mediastinum, with a size of 149 mm x 107 mm. Upon enhancement, the mass was in a cystic-solid pattern with a clear boundary, and the septa and calcification can be seen. The tumor protruded to the right chest cavity, and the adjacent lung was severely compressed (Figure 1A and B). 
A partial thymectomy with video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. A giant mass with a maximum diameter of 15 cm was resected. In gross, the tumor was encapsulated and the cross-section revealed multilocular cysts, which were measured 0.5-6 cm in the greatest diameters. The cysts were filled with pink-brown fluid. Solid gray-white lesions were in irregular shape and the maximum diameter was 7 cm.
Microscopically, the inner side of the cysts lacked epithelial cell lining and there were hemorrhage, calcification, cholesterol crystal cracks, and edema within cavities (Figure 2A and B). The fibrous septa varied in thickness and contained epithelioid cells with a small number of scattered lymphocytes (Figure 2C). In the solid area, the epithelial cell nests were deposited in the background of spindle cells, presenting a biphasic differentiation with scattered lymphocytes (Figure 2D). Both types of cells were bland-looking and small nucleoli can be seen in epithelial cells. No perivascular spaces or Hassall's corpuscles were found. 
Immunohistochemistry was performed. CK-pan (Figure 2E), P63 (Figure 2F), and E-cadherin were expressed in epithelial cells. The spindle cells were positive for Vimentin (Figure 2G) and EMA. Neither type of cell expressed CD20 (Figure 2H), and the Ki-67 index was less than 5% (Figure 2I). A small number of CD3 and CD5 positive T lymphocytes can be evident. However, these lymphocytes were all negative for CD1a, TdT, and CD99.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the YAP1 and MAML2 break-apart probes and YAP1-MAML2 fusion probes were performed with a FISH detection kit (HealthCare Biotechnology, Wuhan, China).

"A 36-year-old woman presented with the complaint of occasional headaches since one year ago that has exacerbated since one week before the presentation and accompanied by blurred vision. She had no significant past medical or drug history. As the physical examination was unremarkable, brain MRI without gadolinium-based contrast agents was requested, which revealed a large, low-signal, heterogeneous mass in T2 and T1 MRI sequences in the right frontal lobe, extending to the right parietal lobe, and with significant midline shift to the left. To determine the nature of the mass, MRI with contrast injection was performed, showing a peripheral, punctuated enhancing lesion. Given the imaging findings, the differential diagnoses of low-grade glioma and brain lymphoma were rendered (Figure 1). The patient underwent craniotomy and the tissue sample was sent for histologic examination. Macroscopic examination showed multiple fragmented, pale-blue tissue fragments with elastic consistency, resembling cartilage, and totally measuring 8 * 8 * 3 cm. Primary microscopic examination described a neoplastic lesion with cartilaginous lobules and the appearance of whorls and gave the final diagnosis of metaplastic meningioma, WHO grade I. As radiology did not correlate with pathology, the specimen was sent to a neuroradiologist and a neuropathologist for second opinion. The neuroradiologist described a huge intra-axial mass in the frontoparietal area with compression and midline shifts that was non-contrast enhancing. The diagnosis of meningioma and hemangiopericytoma was excluded radiologically as they are contrast-enhancing and the definite radiologic diagnosis was not given. Examination of the specimen by the neuropathologist described a mesenchymal neoplasm, consisting of chondroid lobules without atypia, or necrosis. There was no evidence of brain parenchyma or dura (Figure 2A). As there was no brain tissue or dura in the specimen, the possibility of specimen displacement in the operating room was suggested. However, there was no related surgery in that day. To determine the exact nature of the mass, immunohistochemical staining for EMA, CK, GFAP, and S100 markers was performed, which was positive for S100 and negative for the other three markers (Figure 2B).","1.

"A 63-year-old man came to the outpatient department of Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, Chennai with the chief complaint of pain and swelling in the left side of face since two months along with pain on mouth opening. He also gave history of nasal obstruction with occasional epistaxis. His past medical and surgical history is non-contributory. He had the habit of tobacco, betel nut chewing for the past eight years. He had also undergone uneventful extractions.
Extra oral examination revealed a diffuse swelling on the left side of the face, in the maxillary region. The left infraorbital region was tender on palpation. Intraorally an ulcerated proliferative growth was seen on the left alveolar maxillary region in 24-27 region along with obliteration of buccal vestibule. The surface of the growth was covered with necrotic tissue with pus discharge and bleeding [Figure 1]. Limitation of mouth opening along with bilateral ulceration, bleeding and crust formation at angle of mouth was also observed. Generalized mobility of the teeth was also seen.
The OPG revealed a radiolucent area with bone destruction and obliteration of antrum on the left side. The CT scan revealed a huge enhancing lesion involving the entire left maxillary sinus causing erosion of its superior, medial, and postero-lateral walls, extending up to the nasal cavity, left ethmoid sinus and retro maxillary space [Figure 2].
Microscopic examination of the biopsy specimen revealed pleomorphic undifferentiated epithelial cells in the form of nests and trabeculae separated by thin fibrous connective tissue septa [Figure 3]. The cells were of variable size and shape, large cells with amphophilic cytoplasm with round to oval diffusely hyperchromatic nuclei with or without small nucleoli are seen interspersed with cells which have vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli [Figure 4]. Very few areas of squamous cells were appreciated along with areas of necrosis and increased mitotic activity.
Immunohistochemical assay revealed immunoreactivity of the neoplastic cells to cytokeratin (CK7, 8, 19) [Figure 5] and epithelial membrane antigen.

"A 12-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with asthma 2 years prior presented with increasing shortness of breath, wheezing, and cough. The patient had no history of allergies. The patient had previously been hospitalized several times due to the same symptoms and was treated with bronchodilators and steroids; however, the symptoms did not improve and appeared to increase in severity. A blood test revealed increased neutrophil cell count (13 G/L) and C-reactive protein level (25 mg/L). A chest computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which revealed an intratracheal mass. This mass was well-circumscribed with homogeneous enhancement (Fig. 1). The lung parenchyma was normal, and no mediastinal lymph nodes were observed. Bronchoscopy and tumor resection were indicated. The histological results demonstrated that the tumor cells included epidermoid, mucous, and intermediate cells without keratinization (Fig. 2).","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1.

"A 77-year-old retired male patient referred to our clinic with complaint of swelling and redness in his left leg. He had the diagnosis of cellulitis at his leg and used cefazoline for two weeks. The cellulitis was healed clinically but then he was consulted to our clinic with swelling and hyperemia localized at his knee which was performed total knee arthroplasty (TKA) three years ago. Pain, swelling, hyperemia and limited range of motion were observed in the left knee during physical examination. He had a history of consumption of unpasteurized milk. There was no direct contact to pets or any other animals. A written informed consent was obtained from the patient.
Three aspirations were performed. One aspiration was positive. The antibiogram demonstrated antibiotic sensitivity against trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, linezolid, clindamycin, erythromycin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, levofloxacin and penicillin. Then,","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) 2. Brucellosis 3. Staphylococcal infection 4. Streptococcal infection 5. Septic Arthritis"
"A 70-year-old Japanese woman visited a hematologist for idiopathic thrombocytopenia. During follow-up, she had general fatigue and a persistent low fever. Her urine analysis and abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed pyuria and a left staghorn calculus (Fig. 1a). Thereafter, she was referred to our department for a further examination and treatment for her urinary tract infection.
On the day of her initial visit to our outpatient department, her serum C-reactive protein level was 12.34 mg/dL, white blood cell count was 11,400/muL, and serum creatinine was 0.52 mg/dL. We performed percutaneous nephrostomy for the treatment of her pyelonephritis (Fig. 1b). Thereafter, 2 g/day of ceftriaxone (CTRX) was administered intravenously for 9 days. Her fever reduced, and her inflammation markers decreased. The next month, she visited our department again for fever. CT revealed that her middle and inferior calyx had not been adequately drained (Fig. 2). Two additional nephrostomies were therefore performed. We washed each calyx every day and administered CTRX 2 g/day for 9 days. Inflammation slowly decreased, and thereafter, she left our hospital.
Three months after her initial visit to our department, she underwent open nephrectomy. Due to severe adhesion, the kidney was divided into two pieces and removed (Fig. 3). A pathologic examination revealed that the tumor was SCC accompanied by a cancer pearl (Fig. 4a, b). Foam cells were invading the renal parenchyma, suggesting xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. We were able to detect the area where the urothelial epithelium and squamous epithelium were mixed. This finding suggested that the tumor was derived from the squamous metaplasia due to the staghorn calculus. Immunohistochemical staining showed that GATA3 and P40 were negative, while CK5/6 was positive (Fig. 4c-e). Based on these findings, a diagnosis of SCC rather than urothelial carcinoma or renal cell carcinoma was made. As her kidney had been broken into two pieces, it was difficult to decide whether or not the surgical margin was positive. Her disease's T stage was assumed to be at least pT3.","1.

"A 59-year-old man with a 3-month history of worsening chest pain and shortness of breath was referred to the pulmonary clinic. He had a history of 82 pack-years of tobacco use. He had no notable medical history. On presentation, his oxygen saturation level was 96%, and his lungs were clear to auscultation. Physical examination showed no remarkable findings other than left precordial tenderness. Serum cytokeratin 19 fragment, pro-gastrin-releasing peptide, and neuron-specific enolase were elevated (3.7 ng/ml, 115.3 pg/ml, 14.8 ng/ml, respectively), whereas other tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen, and sialyl Lewis X, were all negative. Serum markers for interstitial pneumonia were not elevated (KL-6, 101 U/ml; surfactant protein-A, 21.3 ng/ml; surfactant protein-D, 25.1 ng/ml). Pulmonary function tests revealed airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC, 62.8%) and reduced diffusion capacity (%DLco, 34.2%; %Kco, 38.0%). Chest CT revealed low attenuation areas, suggesting emphysema and diffuse GGOs along with interlobular septal thickening in both lungs (Fig. 1). Bronchoscopy revealed no obvious abnormalities in the lumen, and bronchoalveolar lavage from the right B5 showed no abnormal findings. Interstitial lung disease was initially suspected; however, transbronchial lung biopsies obtained from multiple lesions showed an adenocarcinoma with a signet-ring morphology (negative for surfactant apoprotein-A, TTF-1, and Napsin A, and positive for CDX-2, cytokeratin 7, and cytokeratin 20) that infiltrated the alveolar septa in all specimens (Fig. 2). The tumor cells contained abundant intracellular mucin. Gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an ulcerative tumor in the stomach. A biopsy of the tumor demonstrated malignant cells with similar morphology and immunophenotype as those in the lungs.","1. Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma 2. Pulmonary adenocarcinoma 3.

"A 78-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to our hospital with a 3-month history of progressive numbness in both lower extremities and gait disturbance. Neurological examination on admission showed mild paralysis of both lower limbs (manual muscle test: right 2/V; left 4/V) and pronounced numbness in the right lower limb. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a solid mass with clear borders in the dorsal medulla oblongata, appearing hypointense on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and T1-WI (WI), and hyperintense on T2-WI, with strong enhancement on gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T1-WI [Figure 1]. Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed a low-attenuating lesion in the same region. Cerebral angiography did not show any vascular abnormalities. Neither whole-body CT nor chest X-ray revealed any obvious abnormalities, including bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy [Figure 2a]. No dissemination was evident on MRI of the whole spinal cord [Figure 2b]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed moderately elevated levels of both protein (227 mg/dL) and lymphocytic cells (52/muL), while concentrations of various markers including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2-R) remained with normal limits. However, beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG) was slightly elevated. Preoperative differential diagnoses included malignant glioma, malignant lymphoma, metastatic tumor, and infectious or inflammatory diseases. To confirm the histological diagnosis and plan effective treatment for the primary disease, we performed surgical biopsy of the enhanced lesion under a midline suboccipital approach with image-guided navigation [Figure 3a]. Intraoperative findings demonstrated that this lesion was gray to yellowish in color and extremely firm without bleeding [Figures 3b and c]. Histopathological examination with hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrated noncaseating granuloma consisting of epithelioid cells [Figure 4a] with infiltration of macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and lymphocytes [Figure 4b-d].

"A previously healthy 35-year-old male complained of intermittent fever and myalgia of 1-month duration. On admission, he was febrile (39.2C), with painful tenderness of the edematous upper arm; however, the overlying skin had no grossly abnormality. Ultrasonography showed a diffusely increased echogenicity in his thickened triceps, brachialis and gluteus muscles. Therefore, a magnetic resonance imaging study was performed (Figure 1).
A confirmatory muscle biopsy was performed on his left triceps and brachialis muscles. These histological specimens showed severe myositis, with predominantly dense infiltration of mature neutrophils, associated disruption of the muscle architecture and tissue necrosis (Figure 2). Microbiological studies and serology for auto-antibodies were negative.
The initial complete blood count revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 20,440/mm3, with a differential count of 7% segmented neutrophils, 22% lymphocytes and 40% blast cells, which were strongly suggestive of leukemia. The serum chemistry studies disclosed an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level of 977 U/L. The patient subsequently underwent a diagnostic bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, which showed replacement of the normal bone marrow with myeloblasts. The flow cytometric findings were positive for CD13, but negative for CD33, CD14 and HLA-DR. Cytogenetic studies showed a normal karyotype (46,XY[20]). PCR of AML1/ETO was negative.

"A 48-year-old Chinese female with HBV infection for 15 years was regularly followed up at gastroenterology outpatient department by abdominal ultrasound (US) and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) screening every six months. In May 2005, abdominal US demonstrated a low echoic nodule, 1.6 x 1.6 cm in size in the sixth segment of the liver and mild parenchymal liver disease (Fig. 1A). She was asymptomatic and no abnormality was disclosed by physical examination. Noncontrast liver computed tomography (CT) showed a 1.6 x 1.6 cm well-circumscribed and low density nodule in the same liver segment (Fig. 1B). Dynamic CT scans showed enhancement of the nodule in the arterial phase and early washout in the portal phase (Figs. 1C and 1D). Serum was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but negative for HBeAg. The serum anti-HCV was also negative. AFP and CEA were within normal range. Based on the imaging findings and underlying HBV infection, small HCC was highly suspected and a US-guided liver biopsy was performed for definite diagnosis. However, the pathological finding suggested a malignant neoplasm originating form neuroendocrine cells (Fig. 2A). The result of immunohistochemical (IHC) stain was positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), synaptophysin, and chromogranin A (Fig. 2B). The pre-operative 24-hour urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) value was within normal limits. We undertook a more thorough investigation to rule out the possibility that the liver tumor was a metastatic carcinoid. This workup included upper and low GI endoscopy, a small bowel series, abdominal US, and chest and abdominal CT scans. All imaging findings were unremarkable. Partial hepatectomy was performed. Small bowel, appendix and large bowel were checked during operation and no tumor was found. No cirrhotic liver was noted. The surgery was performed successfully and the patient recovered well. The resected liver tissue contained a 1.6 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm circumscribed tumor (Fig. 3). Histological examination revealed the round or ovoid neoplastic cells arranged in insular pattern with a rosette formation. There was no tumor embolus in the vessels and the resection line was free from tumor invasion. The IHC stains were positive for chromogranin A, cytokeratin, NSE, and synaptophysin.","1.

"A 76-year-old female patient presented to the department of oral pathology and microbiology with a chief complaint of difficulty in eating for the past 1 week. The patient also gave a history of pain in the upper right back tooth region for 8 months, following which extraction was performed due to the presence of periodontally compromised 16 and 17, after which the symptoms were temporarily relieved. On intraoral examination, a well-defined lesion approximately 2.5 cm x 1.5 cm in size with everted and slightly indurated margins was present on the edentulous alveolar ridge with respect to missing 16 and 17, which was extending to the vestibule. There were no symptoms of nasal regurgitation, but the patient presented with a nasal twang.
The patient was diabetic and was under medication for the past 8 months after extraction was done. Bilateral submandibular lymph nodes were slightly enlarged and mobile. Orthopantomogram showed irregular alveolar bone loss. Water's view depicted slight haziness in the right maxillary sinus and bone loss in the involved area. The patient complained of discomfort in the same region for the past 7 days and also submitted a piece of tissue which had been dislodged from the upper left back tooth region while eating. The tissue was immediately preserved, subjected to decalcification, processed and then histopathologically examined.
The decalcified sections of the hard tissue bit received showed abundant bony trabeculae with empty osteocytic lacunae, absence of osteoblastic rimming and prominent resting and reversal lines. Numerous fungal hyphae and spores of varying morphology were seen in the marrow spaces. Some fungal hyphae were broad, aseptate and ribbon shaped, showing branching at obtuse angles representing Mucorales species, whereas others were thin and septate, showing branching at acute angles representing Aspergillus species [Figure 1]. Fungal spores of varying sizes were observed, exhibiting budding at some places along with fruiting bodies of Aspergillus [Figure 1]. These were easily identified as Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus.
Numerous actinomycotic colonies were also noted along with other bacterial colonies, including both bacilli and cocci arranged in clusters as well as individually in close association with peripheral bony trabeculae [Figure 1]. Focal areas showed chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate comprising lymphocytes. A few small blood vessels, extravasated RBCs, areas of necrosis and vegetable matter were observed. Grocott's methenamine silver staining showed septate Aspergillus hyphae, aseptate Mucorales hyphae and fungal spores along with actinomycotic colonies [Figures 2-5].","Mucormycosis Aspergillosis Actinomycosis Osteomyelitis Fungal osteonecrosis"
"A 35-year-old woman was admitted to the Endocrinology Department of Erciyes University Medical School with an adrenal mass and uncontrolled hypertension. The patient's medical history revealed two genital reconstruction surgery in childhood (at the age of 3 and 15) and high blood pressure, which was first detected at the age of 12. In addition, she was given glucocorticoids in childhood. However, she did not use it regularly afterward and did not use it for the last 5 years. She had regular menses and did not describe any severe complaints in terms of hirsutism. There was consanguinity between her parents. At physical examination, there were hypertension, clitoromegaly, deep voice and mild hirsutism (Ferriman-Gallwey score 10). She took no medication except nifedipine, 60 mg/day, for the treatment of hypertension.
On laboratory evaluation, the patient had hypokalemia (2.7 mmol/L), high serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (279 pg/mL), 11-deoxycortisol (140 ng/ml), total testosterone (236 ng/dL), and androstenedione (> 10 ng/dL) levels. Although the clinical picture was not compatible, in order to exclude pheochromocytoma as a differential diagnosis of adrenal mass, 24-hour urinary free metanephrine and normetanephrine levels were measured, and their levels were 44 mug and 141 mug, respectively (normal ranges: 44-261 mug/24h and 111-419 mug /24h). Some other details of biochemical evaluation are given in Table 1. Classic 11betaOHD was diagnosed with her medical history, physical examination and laboratory evaluation.
Adrenal computed tomography showed diffuse-moderate thickening and hypodense nodular appearance in the right adrenal gland, while a hypodense nodular mass, 74x55 mm in size, was detected in the left adrenal gland (Fig. 1). Due to the presence of macroscopic fat densities in the mass, myelolipoma was considered as a preliminary diagnosis of the adrenal mass. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed, and","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) 2. Cushing's Syndrome 3. Pheochromocytoma 4. Classic 11betaOHD 5.

"A 30-year-old Caucasian patient, without any significant medical, allergologic or surgical history, presented initially with right neuralgia-like costal pain. After several months of misdiagnosis, a workup including angio-CT revealed a suspicious mediastinal mass of 5 x 8 cm behind the right bronchus, parenchymal pulmonary micronodules, and a thickening of the diaphragmatic cupola with pleural and pericardial reactions. A PET-CT discovered a second right paravertebral focus and several suspect lymph nodes. A thoracoscopic biopsy was performed and a histopathological examination revealed the presence of a malignant tumor that did not express epithelial or lymphoid markers but expressed markers of soft and melanocyte tissues, including S100a, HMB45, NKIC3, and Melan-A. Furthermore, a BRAF v600e mutation was evidenced.","1. Malignant melanoma with metastasis 2. Clear cell sarcoma 3. PEComa (perivascular epithelioid cell tumor) 4. Soft tissue sarcoma NOS 5.

"A 49-year-old woman presented with abdominal distension and pain. She did not have abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge. Four years previously she had a left breast lump biopsy which suggested ILC grade II with in situ component. She was cT3N2M0. Tumour was weak positive for ER and diffuse strong positive for PR. She underwent left modified radical mastectomy. Postoperative histology showed no evidence of residual tumour and 11 out of 16 lymph nodes dissected were positive. Subsequently, she received adjuvant chemotherapy with three cycles of 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide followed by three cycles of docetaxel. Following this, adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to chest wall and drainage areas at a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Simultaneously, she was started on tamoxifen. She was on regular follow-up from the breast clinic without any evidence of recurrence.
Physical examination at the time of admission showed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2 with bilateral pedal oedema. There was no pallor or lymph node enlargement. There was no evidence of local recurrence. The opposite breast and axilla were normal. An abdominal wall oedema was elicited with no other significant findings. Pelvic examination disclosed a hard mass of cervix obliterating the fornices and of restricted mobility. The first possibility of a second malignancy of cervix was considered clinically.
Further investigation with CT abdomen and pelvis showed moderate to gross ascites with irregular soft tissue stranding in the omentum. Bilateral irregular soft tissue density mass lesions noted in adnexa, on the right measuring 42 x 33 mm and on the left measuring 43 x 21 mm. (Figure 4). Para-aortic nodal mass seen as heterogenous conglomerate soft tissue attenuation. The stomach showed diffuse irregular wall thickening.
Endoscopic-guided biopsy of the stomach was done which was negative for malignancy. Ascitic fluid cytology revealed adenocarcinoma. A punch biopsy from the cervix mass showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with lobular growth pattern and occasional signet ring cells. (Figure 5). The metastatic tumour cells were strongly positive for cytokeratin and negative for E cadherin. Tumour cells exhibited immunopositivity for ER and PR similar to the initial tumour.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Metastatic breast cancer 2. Primary ovarian cancer 3.

"An 87-year-old man with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C virus infection presented with diarrhea and sudden-onset pain in the lower abdomen that gradually increased in severity. On arrival, he was conscious and alert, with a blood pressure of 139/62 mm Hg, heart rate of 98 beats/min, temperature of 39.3  C, and a peripheral oxygen saturation of 97% at ambient air. There were no cardiovascular or respiratory abnormalities. Guarding and rebound tenderness were observed over the entire abdomen, particularly the lower quadrant. Laboratory tests revealed the following: white blood cells, 4500/muL with left deviation (neutrophils, 94.7%); C-reactive protein, 0.16 mg/dL; hemoglobin, 11.6 g/dL; platelet count, 5.2 x 104/muL; prothrombin time, 11.7 s; international normalized ratio, 1.04; total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.9 g/dL; aspartate transaminase, 51 IU/L; alanine transaminase, 36 IU/L; and serum creatinine, 0.81 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) revealed circumferential thickening of the cecum and a small volume of ascites in the pelvic cavity (Fig. 1). A diagnosis of peritonitis was made, and surgery was performed to identify the cause. Surgical findings included redness and thickening of the cecal wall and purulent ascites without intestinal contents. The abdominal cavity was washed, a drain was placed in the pelvic cavity, and postoperative intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated. The postoperative course was uneventful. Three days after surgery, peritoneal fluid culture revealed E. tarda as the sole pathogen.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.

"An 87-year-old Japanese female with complaints of abdominal pain and constipation was admitted to our hospital in March 2016. She had been suffering from type 2 diabetes mellites for almost forty years and had Hashimoto's disease. She did not require insulin but was on oral antidiabetics and thyroid replacement therapy. There has been no history of drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes. However, her husband was a heavy smoker. She was 153 cm tall, and her body weight was 44.8 kg with body mass index (BMI) of 19.1 kg/m. Her abdomen was flat and soft. She had a dull tenderness in her right lower abdomen. She was not jaundiced. Main laboratory findings on admission revealed as follows: HbA1c 8.2%, free T4 1.13 ng/dL, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 4.19 iU/ mL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 4.7 ng/mL, carbohydrate associated antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) 200.6U/mL, s-pancreas antigen-1 67.9 U/mL.

She had a 40-year history of type 2 diabetes, and she was on oral antidiabetics but never required insulin. She also had Hashimoto's disease, but thyroid replacement was discontinued after normalization of thyroid hormone profiles in sera. She denied smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol. However, her husband was a heavy smoker. She was 149 cm tall and her body weight was 48 kg (BMI 21.6 kg/m). Physical status on admission was stable except tenderness in her upper abdomen. She was not jaundiced. She did not have hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, and there was no palpable mass in the abdomen.

"A 42-year-old man presented with vertigo and progressive diplopia on extreme lateral right gaze. He denied tinnitus, hearing loss, headaches, and was found to be grossly neurologically intact. Magnetic resonance (MR) of the brain revealed a lesion demonstrating T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity with peripheral and septal enhancement in the right CPA [Figure 1]. Whether this lesion was intra-axial or extra-axial was not clear. After discussion with the patient regarding options for management, the decision was made to proceed with surgical resection.
The patient was booked for a retrosigmoid craniotomy for removal of the CPA tumor. A right frontal external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed at the beginning of the case. During craniotomy, retraction of the cerebellum revealed the tumor to be extra-axial [Figure 2]. The gross appearance of the tumor was suggestive of a highly vascular lesion, and so intraoperatively, a decision was made to attempt an en-bloc resection. The tumor was circumferentially dissected from the cranial nerve VII/VIII complex as well as from the choroid plexus at the foramen of Luschka. Following this, vascular feeders of the tumor were coagulated and the tumor was excised. Frozen sections returned consistent with low-grade tumor. Final pathology showed epithelioid foamy stromal cells with abundant thin-walled capillary-like vessels. The stromal cells were positive for inhibin, vimentin, and S-100. Reticulin and CD34 staining outlined the dense reticular capillary network of the tumor, but the typical dense pericellular network found in schwannoma was not present. No expression of epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) or progesterone receptor was observed. MIB1 index was <5%.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Acoustic Neuroma 2.

"A 12-year-old female with a symptomatic first left lower molar was observed at a private clinic. She complained of severe lingering pain to cold lasting for few minutes. She also complained of spontaneous pain during the day and at night time. Review of the patient's medical history revealed no significant findings.
Extraoral evaluation revealed normal soft tissue structures with no apparent pathosis. Intraoral examination showed a first left lower molar with a large carious lesion. Diagnostic tests were performed; the involved tooth responded with mild pain to percussion and severe lingering pain to Endo-Frost cold spray (Roeko; Coltene Whaledent, Langenau, Germany).
Radiographic examination showed a large carious lesion associated with apical periodontitis [Figure 1]. The adjacent/opposing teeth were asymptomatic and responded normally to all diagnostic tests. Based on the clinical and radiographic examinations, the diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis with apical periodontitis was made. Thereafter, IPT of the tooth was decided; an informed consent was obtained from the patient's legal guardian.
The patient was instructed to rinse her mouth with 0.2% chlorhexidine. The tooth was anesthetized with 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine (DarouPakhsh, Tehran, Iran) and then isolated with rubber dam. Subsequently the dentin-enamel junction was completely excavated. The bulk of soft carious dentin was carefully removed by tungsten-carbide round burs (Komet, Lemgo, Germany) at low speed; medium and large spoon excavators (Ash, London, UK) were also used. Excavation was terminated once the remaining carious dentin showed increased resistance to manual instrumentation. After that, the remaining carious dentin in pulpal floor was covered by  1.5 mm layer of CEM cement (BioniqueDent, Tehran, Iran). The remaining tooth cavity was then restored/sealed with glass-ionomer cement and composite resin sandwich technique [Figure 2].
The patient was re-examined clinically after 1 and 7 days. At the 1-day follow-up the patient complained of sensitivity to cold which had significantly decreased 1 week post-operatively. Tenderness to percussion was not reported in both follow-ups. Patient was recalled at 1 year for clinical/radiographic follow-up. Clinical examination with cold test showed a vital tooth which was functional, asymptomatic, with normal physiologic mobility, normal probing depths, and a satisfactory coronal restoration. Radiographic examinations showed normal periodontium, and evidence of periapical healing [Figures 3 and 4].","1. Irreversible pulpitis 2. Apical periodontitis 3. Dental caries 4. Pulp degeneration 5.

"A 54-year-old Japanese man was referred to Nagara Medical Center for the evaluation of a GGO, which was found incidentally within the right upper lung on computed tomography (CT). Chest CT showed a pure GGO lesion measuring 8 mm in diameter in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe (Fig. 1). The patient had quit smoking approximately 15 years previously. He had regularly seen a family doctor for chronic gastritis. The laboratory workup, including tests for tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, and cytokeratin 19 fragment, did not show remarkable results. The lesion was suspected to be a slow-growing early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. For diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, a segmentectomy (anterior segment of the right upper lobe) was performed via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Pathologic examination showed thickening of the alveolar septum caused by the proliferation of capillary vessels without cytological atypia (Fig. 2A).

"A 60-year-old male patient visited our hospital with vomiting, pain in abdomen and distension of abdomen since one month. He also gives history of weight loss, loss of appetite, low grade fever. He was non-smoker and non-alcoholic. He had no significant past history of pulmonary tuberculosis or any contact with patient of TB or neither had HIV infection. He was not screened for diabetes mellitus and hypertension. On examination he was afebrile, regular pulse at 84/min. His blood pressure was 120/70 mmhg. He was anicteric and there was no lymphadenopathy. On abdominal examination shifting dullness and fluid thrill suggestive of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity was present. Spleen was not palpable. Investigation revealed haemoglobin of 9 gram percent, fasting blood sugar was 98 mg/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 90 mm/1st hour. His tuberculin test was positive (18 mm). The HIV serologic test was negative. Other Blood biochemical profile like liver function test and kidney function test were within normal limits. The chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed ascites with multiple ill defined areas of hypoechogenesity in spleen. The axial contrast enhanced Computerised Tomography showed irregular hypo dense peripherally enhancing lesions in spleen, and fluid in anterior perihepatic space suggestive of splenic abscess [Figure 1]. There was no bowel thickening, no septa and no lymph node enlargement. The computed tomography (CT) guided fine needle aspiration biopsy from hypo echogenic area of spleen was performed. The cytomorphology showed granulomas with area of caseation in the centre surrounded by variable number of langhans giant cells and epitheloid cells favouring diagnosis of tuberculosis [Figure 2]. Culture and polymerase chain reaction based confirmation could not be contemplated due to inadequacy of sample. Ascitic fluid examination revealed total white cell count of 450 with lymphocyte 85%, protein 4.6 mg/dl, glucose 60 mg/dl, LDH 442 u/l, cholesterol 43 mg/dl. Serum ascitic albumin gradient was 0.8 suggestive of exudative fluid. Tuberculosis is one of the common causes of exudative fluid in this part of the world.

"A 65-year-old female had a history of several cancers, including left breast cancer at 36 years of age, cecum cancer in her forties and right breast cancer at 64 years of age. Her mother, younger sister and daughter also each had a history of breast cancer. At 60 years of age, the patient underwent sigmoidectomy and right colectomy with D3 lymph node dissection for both sigmoid colon cancer (fig. 1) and transverse colon cancer. During that operation, lavage of the remnant colon was performed before anastomosis, and automatic anastomotic devices were used. The pathological diagnoses revealed both sigmoid colon cancer and transverse colon cancer of T3N0M0, stage IIA. Both the oral and anal margins of the resected colon had a sufficient length: the transverse margin measured 135 mm (oral wedge) and 50 mm (anal wedge), while the sigmoid margin measured 40 mm (oral wedge) and 50 mm (anal wedge) (fig. 1a). At 3-year follow-up, colonoscopy and computed tomography revealed no signs of recurrence (fig. 2a). At 5-year follow-up, colonoscopy demonstrated surrounding flaring and swelling in the anastomotic area of the sigmoid colon (fig. 2b). A biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma. The levels of the tumor markers CEA and CA19-9 were both within the normal limits at that time. There were no signs of recurrence in other locations, such as the liver and lungs, or other areas of the remnant colon. Therefore, under a diagnosis of anastomotic recurrence over 5 years after surgery, we performed lower anterior resection. The tumor measured 45 x 35 mm and was located at the previous anastomotic site (fig. 3a). Pathology revealed histological features that resembled the pattern of the previous tumor, and there were masses of cancerous cells in the subserosal and muscular layers near the fissured muscular layer, which comprised the anastomotic area (fig. 3b). In addition, in the mucous membranes surrounding the anastomotic area, there was hyperplasia of cancerous cells that pushed up layers from deeper mucous membranes. Furthermore, there were no cancerous cells in the mucous membranes, which indicated that the cells were derived from the primary lesion (fig. 3b). Based on these observations,","1. Lynch Syndrome 2.

"A 71-year old Caucasian male with dilative cardiomiopathy and irrelevant family history was admitted to our hospital for the evaluation of a suspected liver disease. The physical examination was within the normal limits, except for hepatomegaly. Laboratory findings revealed a slight anemia (hemoglobin level of 12,5 g/dl, hematocrit of 38%, red blood cells count of 3,9 mil/mm3). White blood cells count was 8730/mm3 and platelet count was 258000/mm3. Biochemical test showed normal serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT=20 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST=15 IU/L) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP=120 IU/L) and elevated gammagluta - myltranspeptidase (GGT=230 IU/L). Alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen were within normal limits. Ultrasound showed multiple small hypo- and hyperechoic lesion foci, some cystic lesions with comet-tail echoes, the biggest cyst measured 8 mm in the VIIth segment (Fig. 1). CT scan revealed multiple small cystic lesions; the largest hypodense nodule was in the VIIth hepatic segment with no peripheral or central enhancement (Fig. 2). The CT examination was not conclusive and a MRI with MRCP was performed next. Multiple small cystic lesions were detected with T1 hyposignal and T2 hypersignal, the largest being in segment VII (Fig. 3).

"The patient, a 22-year-old woman was referred to the dental surgeon with the chief complaint of swelling in the right side of maxilla and drainage of a yellow liquid into the mouth. The lesion was asymptomatic and clinical examination revealed facial asymmetry. Intraorally, expansion of the vestibular and palatine cortical bone of the maxilla were observed, covered with normal oral mucosa and without any signs of inflammation. Radiographically a unilocular and well-delimitated radiolucency, in the right side of the maxilla was noted, with 8 months of evolution. Furthermore, displacement of the second maxillary right molar and root resorption of the teeth (second and third molars) involved were observed, as well as the absence of the first molar (Fig. 1). Cone-beam computed tomography revealed a hypodense lesion in relation to the maxillary sinus, from tooth 14-18 (Figs. 2 and 3 A). Axial and coronal views showed erosion of the vestibular and palatine sinus walls (Fig. 2). Root resorption of tooth 17 and 18 could be noted in the parasagittal view in the tomograph (Fig. 3B and C). Some radiopacities observed inside the lesion were suggestive of calcification or dental fragments (Fig. 3D and E). Fine needle aspiration (5 mL) of a citrine liquid and an incisional biopsy were performed. The clinical hypothesis was of odontogenic tumor or fibro-osseous lesion. Microscopic analysis showed a cystic cavity lined by a thin odontogenic epithelium forming cords or islands and with basal cells arranged in palisade, with vacuolated cytoplasm, while central cells resembled stellate reticulum (Fig. 4A and B). In some areas, the odontogenic epithelium was organized with duct-like structures containing an eosinophilic and amorphous material. Some foci of mineralized dentin characterized by a tubular formation and globular calcification Fig. 4C-F) interlaced with osteodentin containing cells, were detected (Fig. 4G and H). The enamel matrix, predentin and ectomesenchyme were not evident in this tumor. According to the clinical, radiographic and microscopic features,","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1.

"A 25-year-old man with extreme obesity reported a 1-year history of cough and was treated for asthma without relief of his symptoms. He subsequently developed hemoptysis prompting computed tomography that revealed a 3.6 x 3.9 x 4.9 cm mass within the wall of the trachea that caused critical narrowing of the trachea ( Fig. 1 ). 
The patient was found to be in near extremis with inspiratory stridor and was taken to the operating room urgently to secure the airway with bronchoscopic debridement. Awake anesthesia was performed, and a flexible bronchoscope was used to pass a 5-0 endotracheal tube distal to the tumor. The right internal jugular vein was then percutaneously cannulated with a 31-Fr Avalon Elite catheter (Maquet, Wayne, New Jersey, United States) under fluoroscopic and echocardiographic guidance and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was then initiated. The tumor was biopsied via rigid bronchoscopy and thereafter bled extensively. Despite application of neosynephrine and argon coagulation, bleeding only ceased following passage of an 8-0 endotracheal tube distal to the tumor.
 Further attempt at bronchoscopic debridement was aborted, and the patient was decannulated and returned to the intensive care unit intubated. On review of the pathology ( Fig. 2 ), the tumor was composed of nests of monotonous round cells and thin-walled vessels containing focally infiltrating smooth muscle. Immunohistochemistry stains were positive for smooth muscle actin and negative for chromogranin. While rare, these findings suggested tracheal glomus tumor. 
 The patient was then brought back to the operating room for definitive resection. Repeat flexible bronchoscopy revealed that the tracheal tumor was located approximately 4 cm distal to the larynx and extended to 4 cm proximal to the carina. A collar incision with an upper partial median sternotomy was performed to expose the tumor fully. The tumor was found to involve the right tracheal wall with extraluminal extension, but without invasion of the surrounding structures. The trachea was circumferentially dissected, and the tumor was excised ( Fig. 3 ) with the use of cross-table ventilation and an armored endotracheal tube. The trachea was reconstructed end-to-end without the need for releasing maneuvers or endoscopic stenting. The left sternohyoid muscle was mobilized and placed between the tracheal anastomosis and the innominate artery. The patient was then extubated and returned to the intensive care unit. 
Postoperatively, the patient developed pneumonia that required bronchoscopy, and the hospital course was otherwise unremarkable. In review at our multidisciplinary tumor board,","1.

"A 70-year-old male never-smoker experienced an 8-kg weight loss during 6 months, alternating diarrhoea/obstipation without bloody stools, slight coughing, and dyspnoea. He had a history of hypertension for many years, uncomplicated and treated with losartan/thiazide 50/12.5 mg and amlodipine 10 mg once daily. Nine years earlier, he was diagnosed with a transitiocellular, papillary bladder tumour, grade III with invasion; underwent successful endoscopic resection without need for oncological treatment; and was followed with annual cystoscopy. Three years later, he was surgically treated for a relapse of transitiocellular, papillary bladder tumour (grade I) and was followed for an additional 5 years without signs of recurrent disease at annual cystoscopy.
He was a retired industrial worker but with no known occupational exposure to asbestosis, silica, or dust. He was living with his spouse and had no hobbies resulting in exposure to hazardous fumes or dusts.
He was referred to an outpatient colonoscopy (17 months after he ended urological control visits), revealing an obstructing lower rectal mass. Only a paediatric coloscope could pass the lesion, and biopsies revealed adenocarcinoma, immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses positive for CK7 and TTF-1 (Fig. 1), and negative for GATA, CK20, CDX2, PLAP, CD117, PSA, and S100P. PCR showed wild-type EGFR status. Direct histological comparison showed no resemblance with his urological cancer.
Thoracoabdominal contrast-enhanced PET-CT scan showed multiple, PET-positive, enlarged mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, a right-sided pleural effusion and associated ipsilateral compression lower lobe atelectasis, ascites, and a tumour located in the rectum with invasion to levator muscles and vesicula seminalis (Figs. 2 and 3). Cytological sampling from mediastinal lymph nodes and pleural exudate showed identical adenocarcinoma including IHC profile cells with a high proliferation index assessed by Ki-67. A bronchoscopy showed no visual tumour.

"A 74-year-old male was admitted after 24 hours of abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient had accidentally ingested a mango seed 4 days before developing abdominal pain. He did not have any previous medical conditions or abdominal surgery. A physical examination showed normal vital parameters, a distended abdomen, and no evidence of peritonitis or abdominal external hernias. An abdominal x-ray revealed dilation of the small bowel and a circular image in the inferior right quadrant of the abdomen. A colonoscopy identified a hard mass in the terminal ileum, which could not be removed endoscopically. A laparoscopy by the open technique was performed with a 10-mm port placed in the umbilicus. Pneumoperitoneum was established to a maximum pressure of 13mm Hg. After an initial diagnostic laparoscopy, 2 additional 5-mm working ports were placed under direct vision, 6 cm above the umbilicus and 6cm below it in the middle line of the abdomen. The abdominal cavity was inspected carefully with atraumatic bowel graspers to minimize the risk of bowel injury. A mechanical obstruction due to a hard intraluminal mass was located approximately 5cm from the ileocecal junction (Figure 1). The small bowel was examined from the ligament of Treitz to the cecum to ensure that the obstruction did not involve other areas. Also dilation of the small bowel and ascitic fluid were noted. An ileotomy was performed with a Harmonic scalpel (Ultracision - Ethicon Endo Surgery) along the longitudinal axis (Figure 2), which allowed the removal of a 5.0x5.0x4.0-cm phytobezoar that could not be milked towards the colon (Figure 3). The phytobezoar was extracted in a latex bag (Figure 4). A larger incision on the umbilicus was made to facilitate the removal of the bezoar. The ileotomy was closed along the longitudinal axis with interrupted suture using 3-0 Vicryl (Figure 5). The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient stayed in the hospital for 4 days.","1. Intestinal obstruction 2. Phytobezoar formation 3. Mechanical ileus 4. Small bowel dilation 5.

"A 36-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department of the Cancer Center, complaining of fever, chills, night sweats, diarrhea, and painful oral lesions, over the past3 days. The patient had a medical history of liver transplantation8 years before, due to biliary cirrhosis, and was taking prednisone 5mg/day and mycophenolate sodium 360 mg. She also reported cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection 3 months after the transplantation, which was successfully treated with ganciclovir. The oral examination showed three well-defined shallow ulcerative lesions covered by fibrin with regular erythematous borders on the hard palate, measuring 1 cm (Figure 1A); on the vestibular and palatal gingiva between the 16 and 17 teeth measuring 0.5 cm (Figure 1B); and on the left soft palate near the uvula measuring 1.0 cm (Figure 1C).
According to the clinical findings and the previous history of CMV, the main diagnostic hypotheses were CMV reactivation or herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Exfoliative cytology of oral lesions was performed and an anti-CMV immunoglobulin (Ig)G test was requested. Because of the immunosuppression, ganciclovir 300mg tid was prescribed, but no improvement was observed within 7 days. Since the exfoliative cytology and the anti-CMV IgG tests were negative, the hypothesis of viral infection became less probable. A chest x-ray was normal, which ruled out lung involvement. Due to the worsening of oral lesions and the presence of gastrointestinal tract symptoms, two oral incisional biopsies:in the gingival and the palate:were taken, and a colonoscopy was performed with biopsy of a rectal lesion. The colonoscopy image showed areas with inflammatory process and eroded mucosa with an extensive ulcer measuring 2 cm on the descending colon extending to the rectum (Figure 2).
Histological sections of oral cavity biopsies revealed fragments of squamous mucosa with intense histiocytic inflammatory infiltrate associated with rounded fungal structures, which were consistent with H. capsulatum, and were confirmed by Gomori-Grocott's staining in the gum and the palate (Figure 3). Similar findings were observed in the rectal biopsy. Based on the clinical and histopathologic findings,","1. Histoplasmosis 2. CMV reactivation 3. HSV infection 4. Invasive aspergillosis 5.

"A 16-year-old girl presented with a 6-month history of primary amenorrhea and pain in the abdomen. She also noticed excessive facial hair growth during the 6-month period. The weight of the patient was 55 kg. The height was normal for her age. She had normal secondary sexual development. There was male pattern of hair distribution [Figure 1]. Breast development was Tanner Stage IV. Pubic hair development was Tanner Stage V. Clitomegaly was present. Uterus and adenexa were normal on per rectal examination. Her blood pressure was normal and there was no diabetes mellitus. The total testosterone level was raised and value was 435 ng/dl (normal range, 14-76 ng/dl). Dehydroepiandrosteronesulfate (DHEA-S) level was >1500 mug/dl (normal range, 61-493 mug/dl). Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) level was 10.10 mg/24 h (normal range, <15.0 mg/24 h). Rest of the blood parameters were normal.
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed on a 64-slice multidetector MDCT scanner (GE light speed VCT XTe whole body 64 slice CT system from Wipro GE Healthcare Private Limited). On noncontrast CT scan, there was a well-defined hypodense mass of size 11.6 x 10.7 x 12 cm, with scattered areas of calcifications. Center of the mass showed a stellate shaped noticeably hypodense area. Plain CT attenuation was around 59 HU. Arterial phase scan (acquired at 30 s) showed a tangle of serpiginous, thin intratumoral vessels throughout the mass except in the central stellate nonenhancing area [Figure 2]. These vessels gave a can-of-worms like appearance on volume rendered images [Figure 3]. The periphery of the mass was supplied by dilated, thick, tortuous vessels arising from phrenic and renal vessels [Figure 2]. The average postcontrast attenuation of the mass was around 70HU. It had a thin intensely enhancing capsule. In the venous phase scan (acquired at 60 s), the mass showed homogenous enhancement except for the central nonenhancing area [Figure 4]. The values were in the range of around 103 HU. The right kidney was pushed inferomedially by this mass. The fat planes with liver were maintained. There was no lymphadenopathy or ascites. Big vessels were normal.
Open right adrenalectomy was performed. The tumor was round in shape and well encapsulated [Figure 5]. It was highly vascular and had blood supply from the aorta, renal, and phrenic vessels. The histopathological examination showed oncocytic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and small round nuclei. There was no mitosis. Necrosis was seen in the smears [Figure 6].","1.

"A59-year-old male reported with a chief complaint of a growth on the left side of upper lip. The lesion had been present for the last 6 months with gradual increase in size. Previously, the patient had undergone surgical excision of the lesion twice in the same area from an outside clinic only to notice it regrow again. He had the habit of smoking cigarettes for the past 25 years, around 20 cigarettes per day. The patient also gave a history of anemia for the past 1 month and was taking folic acid medication regularly. No other signs and symptoms were present.
On close clinical examination, an exophytic growth was seen on the left corner of upper lip. The growth was about 1.5 cm in length and was brown. On palpation, the growth was firm to hard in consistency and was slightly tender. Intraoral examination revealed a grayish-white patch on the left commissural mucosa and the dorsum of tongue measuring about 3 cm x 1 cm in dimension. Both the white patches were nontender and nonscrapable in nature. Hard tissue examination revealed several missing teeth (15, 16, 17, 25, 26, 27 and 46) and Grade II mobility with respect to teeth (11, 21, 22, 23, 31, 41, 42 and 47). Generalized gingival recession and attrition were also seen in Figure 1.
Excision of the lesion on the lip along with its adjacent grayish-white patch was done using CO2 laser. Satisfactory healing was observed after a week. The gross specimen received measured about 28 mm x 7 mm x 4 mm. One end of the specimen was soft in consistency, and the other end was firm which represents the horn [Figure 2].
The histological sections revealed hyperkeratotic stratified squamous epithelium with underlying connective tissue. The epithelium exhibited acanthosis, spongiosis, hyperkeratosis and broad rete pegs with pushing margins along with parakeratinized keratin plugging. The underlying connective tissue exhibited mild inflammatory cell infiltration, areas of hemorrhage and muscle fibers bundles in cross sections [Figure 3]. The superficial layer of epithelium in one area showed exuberant keratinization in concentric layers forming a cutaneous horn [Figure 4].","1. Squamous Cell Carcinoma 2. Cutaneous Horn 3.

"A 63-year-old male came to our clinic due to progressively enlarging masses over the bilateral posterior neck for more than 1 year. There was no fever, body weight loss, nasal obstruction/bleeding, facial numbness/swelling, aural fullness, dry mouth, hemoptysis, short of breath, chest pain, or other discomfort mentioned. Physical examination revealed multiple, nontender, mobile, and solid masses in the posterior triangle region. No thyroid mass was found. No redness or swelling over preauricular, submandibular, or mouth floor region was noted. His bilateral tympanic membrane was intact. Oral cavity examination and nasopharyngoscopic examination revealed no remarkable findings. Review of system also showed negative findings. US was performed using a color Doppler US unit (Toshiba Aplio 500) and a 5-14 MHz broadband linear array transducer [Video]. Multiple matted, ovoid, homogenous, hypoechoic and enlarged lymph nodes [Figure 1] were seen below the right parotid gland. There was also heterogeneous echotextures with small and indistinct hypoechoic nodules over bilateral parotid and submandibular glands [Figure 2]. US-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) of the right neck lymphadenopathies was performed. A 9 cm length modified nonadvancing, disposable, spring-loaded 18 gauze cutting biopsy needle (Temno biopsy system, Allegiance Healthcare corp., McGaw Park, IL, USA) with 15-mm side-notch was used for CNB. Two cores of tissue were sent for the pathological examination. The pathology suggested reactive hyperplasia. However, it was difficult to exclude low-grade lymphoma due to incomplete architectural evaluation of the biopsy specimens; therefore, the patient underwent excisional biopsy of the right neck lymph node. Laboratory examination showed marked elevation of serum IgG4 (4660 mg/dL). The white blood cell count (6.85 k/muL), anti-Ro antibody (17 AU/ml), and anti-La antibody (30 AU/ml) were within normal limit. The pathology of excisional biopsy specimens revealed reactive hyperplasia with scattered plasma cells in germinal centers and mildly increased plasma cells in interfollicular areas [Figure 3]. Focal penetration of blood vessels in the germinal center was also noted. Immunostainings for IgG and IgG4 revealed that the ratio of IgG4+/IgG+ plasma cells were >40% [Figure 4].","1.

"A 61-year-old Japanese woman presented with induration on the left forearm. The family history was not remarkable. The medical history included bladder cancer diagnosed 10 weeks earlier, which was resected surgically. Inadvertently, the left iliac artery was occluded during the operation. This was treated intraoperatively by common iliac artery bypass and intravenous infusion of 2% calcium chloride into the arm vein to induce vasoconstriction. Postoperatively, no extravasation of the injected preparation was noted on the arm, but a red flare appeared around the area of administration. The red flare gradually led to induration and ulcer formation. The patient was referred to the Department of Dermatology at postoperative week 7 for further management.
Physical examination showed an indurated plaque of 13 x 65 mm with linearly distributed ulcers covered by yellowish-white material, and the entire lesion was surrounded by reddish skin (fig. 1). Laboratory data showed BUN 25.2 mg/dl (normal: 7.0-22.0), serum creatinine 0.97 mg/dl (normal: 0.3-0.8), serum calcium 9.3 mg/dl (normal: 8.0-10.5), serum phosphate 4.4 mg/dl (normal: 4.0-6.0), and high sensitivity-parathyroid hormone 460 pg/ml (normal: 160-520). Cultures were negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungi.
Two skin biopsy samples were obtained from the left forearm. The histopathological findings were similar in the two specimens and included deposition of basophilic amorphous substance in the upper and middle dermis (fig. 2a), but not in the subcutis. The amorphous material was eliminated transepithelially, with partial defect of the epidermis and substitution with crust. There was granulomatous infiltration surrounding the amorphous material with underlying collagen accumulation. Histiocytic infiltrates intermingled with lymphocytes and giant cells among the collagen fibers (fig. 2b). The amorphous substance stained black with von Kossa staining (fig. 2c).

"Patient 46-year-old male had reported the appearance of an erythematous nodule on the dorsum of the right foot four months before the appointment. The nodule evolved with progessive growth and ulceration. One month before, the patient presented with hardnodules on his right arm, leg and tight, following an upward path culminating in bulging in the ipsilateral inguinal region (Figure 3). Physical examination, laboratory test and CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed no sistemic involvement. Anti-HIV and anti-HTLV serologies were negative. Skin biopsy revealed diffuse infiltration in the dermis, composed of rounded cells of conspicuous cytoplasm with large pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, sometimes cleaved, which allowed the visualization of one or more irregular nucleoli. Mitoses were easily observed (Figure 4). Immunohistochemistry resulted positive reaction for anti-CD45LCA, anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD30, and negative for anti-CD20, anti-ALK (anaplastic large cell lymphoma kinase), anti-AE1/AE3, anti-Melan-A, anti-CD56, and anti-CD8. 80% of the cells were positive for Ki-67.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1.

"A 60-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital for evaluation of back pain. His past medical and family history was unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasound showed a hypoechoic mass with clear margins measuring 30 mm in diameter in the pancreatic tail. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass protruding from the pancreatic tail with no dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (Fig. 1). The mass was circumscribed and there was delayed contrast enhancement. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging was performed for further characterization of the lesion; the mass presented as low intensity on T1-weighted imaging and slightly high intensity on T2-weighted imaging (Fig. 2). On the basis of the above findings, we initially suspected a solid pseudopapillary tumor or a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The patient underwent laparoscopic evaluation which revealed that the edge of the tumor was relatively distinct, but strongly adherent to the pancreas (Fig. 3). Subsequently, laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy was performed for radical excision. The operating time was 255 min, and blood loss was minimal. The patient did not have any complications and was discharged 10 days after surgery.
Gross examination of the tumor revealed a circumscribed, gray, and solid mass measuring 30 mm arising from the pancreatic tail. Histology showed an abnormal proliferation of spindle cells, without strong atypia. The tumor infiltrated the pancreatic interlobular connective tissue (Fig. 4). Pathological analysis confirmed that the resection was complete. Immunostaining was negative for s-100, desmin, and c-kit, and positive for beta-catenin and actin-smooth muscle.","1.

He reported weakness in his left leg along with balance problems (e.g., stumbling but not falling). The neurological exam revealed mild weakness of the hip flexors bilaterally, left side greater than right, hyperactive patellar and Achilles responses, and bilateral Babinski signs. The thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an extra-axial T2 hyperintense and T1 isointense soft tissue mass at the T5-T7 levels resulting in extrinsic compression of the spinal cord [Figure 1a and b]. The main differential diagnosis based on exam findings and imaging was a meningioma.
The patient was taken to the operation room and a laminectomy was performed at the T4-T8 levels. Excessive epidural fatty tissue with mild vascular elements was encountered and uneventfully removed. The dura was opened but no intradural lesion was present. Histopathology revealed a lipovascular proliferation with fat and myxoid tissue without malignancy [Figure 2a and b]. On gross analysis, the specimen was an aggregate of red-tan soft tissue fragments measuring 4 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Meningioma 2. Spinal lipoma 3.

"A 28-year-old mother gave birth to a male newborn at the 40th week of gestational age, through an uneventful vaginal delivery. The newborn weighted 3040g, and the Apgar score was 9, 10, 10. During the initial post-delivery examination, the neonatologist detected, as the sole alteration, an irregular, asymmetric, and enlarged right testis of a term newborn. This finding was confirmed by an ultrasonographic examination that showed a heterogeneous solid mass in the right testis without retroperitoneal lymph node involvement. Left testis was descended and external genitalia was normal Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and total human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) determination was 97,819 ng/mL (within normal range for gestational age and birth weight) and 31,4 mUI/mL (reference value: < 5 mUI/mL), respectively.
A right inguinal orchiectomy was performed at 21 hours of age. Gross examination of the surgical specimen showed a light-brown colored, round, and solid mass measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. At the cut surface, a solid and firm sharply defined neoplasia replaced most of the testicle parenchyma, displacing the epididymis peripherally. The morphology was characterized by solid areas, and focal cystic structures resembling follicles containing a light basophilic watery substance (Figure 1A, 1C and 1D). These follicular-resembling areas showed multi-stratified clusters of neoplastic cells. The solid areas predominated and showed a lobulated arrangement formed by large cells with light eosinophilic cytoplasm, with rounded hyperchromatic nuclei and visible nucleoli, besides occasional nuclear infolding (Figure 1B). Mitotic and apoptotic cells were frequent. Immunostainings revealed diffuse positivity for vimentin and focal calretinin and inhibin, and negativity for beta-hCG, alpha-fetoprotein and cytokeratins (Figure 2), thus ruling out yolk sac tumor, which was the major differential diagnosis.","1.

"A 45-year-old male referred to Shahid Beheshti Maxillofacial Pathology Department with a two year history of generalized proliferative gingival maxillary lesions with palatal right side swelling and mandibular labially gingival lesions (Figure 1).
The lesions were asymptomatic, without any bleeding or purulent discharge. The right submandibular lymph node was palpable and the patient noticed this swelling after the extraction of the third molar one month prior to his visit to our department. The gingivally lesions were red and soft with irregular surfaces, and the palatal swelling had a purple-gray appearance with intact overlying mucosa (Figure 2).
Radiographic examination revealed a moderate bone loss similar to a periodontal disease.
Laboratory test results were normal, so the patient's diagnosis was stated as inflammatory and reactive hyperplastic lesions.
The patient's teeth were extracted. Only 2 maxillary central incisors were preserved for esthetic. Tissues needed for histopathologic evaluation were obtained from the gingivectomy of gingivally proliferative masses and with a full thickness flap from the palatal swelling.
Soft tissue specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks. For standard pathological examination, the sections were prepared with H&E stain.
The slides of both gingival and palatal specimens showed a dense cellular infiltration under the epithelial layer in deeper portions.
The cells were mononuclear which showed pleomorphism with moderately amount of cytoplasm and round to oval nucleus with prominent nucleoli. These cells did not have a characteristic phenotype. Therefore, a series of differential diagnosis such as large cell lymphoma, plasmacytoma, poorly differentiated carcinoma and lymphoblastic leukemia was suggested (Figure 3-4).
For the final diagnosis, a panel of antibodies was applied using the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. The tumor cells were diffusely positive with antibodies against LCA, negative with CD20, CD3 and CD79a and positive with C-kit.

"A previously healthy 46-year-old woman presented to our department with a 6-month history of mild headache. Intracranial computed tomography (CT) revealed an iso-dense mass without calcification in the anterior area of the third ventricle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated that the tumor (diameter, 14 x 18 x 18 mm) was predominantly isointense on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and homogeneously enhanced to a high degree with gadolinium (Gd) [Figure 1]. The optic chiasma was displaced downwards, and the anterior wall of the third ventricle was deviated. Perilesional edema reaching up to the mesencephalon bilaterally and the internal capsule associated with compression by the tumor mass were clearly observable on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI [Figure 2]. No pituitary insufficiency was evident from laboratory examinations. Preoperative differential diagnoses included intraventricular meningioma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, and chordoid glioma of the third ventricle. To confirm the histological diagnosis, the tumor was resected microsurgically under an interhemispheric translamina terminalis approach to the third ventricle. Intraoperative examination demonstrated that the tumor was firm, rubbery, and nonsuckable, and appeared to be originating from the lamina terminalis with a clear margin between normal structures including the hypothalamus. We achieved gross total resection of the tumor to reduce compression of the optic nerve. Histopathological examination with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the tumor showed a neoplastic tissue comprising eosinophilic epithelioid cells with large nucleoli arranged in small sheets, within mucinous stroma. Sparse lymphocytic infiltrate was present, and no mitosis was detected [Figure 3]. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using antibodies for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (rabbit polyclonal antibody; DAKO; ready to use), CD34 (mouse monoclonal antibody; clone 9BEnd10; DAKO; ready to use), thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1 (mouse monoclonal antibody; clone 8G7G3/1; DAKO; ready to use), and Ki-67 (mouse monoclonal antibody; clone MIB-1; DAKO; ready to use). Most tumor cells showed immunoreactivity for GFAP and CD34 [Figure 4a and b]. In addition, almost all tumor cells appeared strongly positive for TTF-1 [Figure 4c]. The Ki-67 (MIB-1) proliferation-related labeling index was low, at 2.0% [Figure 4d]. With regard to the genetic profile, these tumor cells were immunonegative for R132H-mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1.

"A 16 years old female without any prior medical history presented to our department for a six months history of productive cough; which was associated with minimal hemoptysis, anterior chest pain, dyspnea, dysphagia, dysphonia and a secondary amenorrhea. She had fatigue, weight loss and night sweats. The physical examination revealed absent tactile fremitus, dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds in the lower part of the right side of the thorax. There were crackling rales in the upper part of the right side of the chest in addition to percussion dullness. Enlarged cervical lymph nodes were found; the largest one had a 2 cm diameter. Chest X ray showed a heterogeneous pulmonary and mediastinal opacity associated to a pleural effusion (Figure 1). The complete blood count showed a neutrophilic leukocytosis (2752/ml), thrombocytosis and hypochromic microcytic anemia (hemoglobin at 10 g/l). The C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased at 197mg/l, the sedimentation rate (sed-rate) was at 111, the Lactate Dehydrogenase test (LDH) was at 342 u/l and a hypocalcaemia. The liver and kidney functions tests were normal. The tuberculin skin test and the sputum acid fast bacilli were negative. The chest CT scan showed mediastinal lymphadenopathies, enlarged axillary lymph nodes in addition to pulmonary nodules and alveolar condensation (Figure 2). The abdominal CT scan showed mesenteric lymphadenopathies and a hepatomegaly. The cervical ultrasound found a thyroid nodule and bilateral necrotic cervical lymphadenopathies. The bronchoscopy showed four white lesions at the entrance of the middle lobe bronchus and the right upper lobe bronchus (Figure 3). A pathology study with immunohistochemistry of the biopsies was performed and concluded to an endobronchial localization of Hodgkin's lymphoma (Figure 4). The pathology of the pleural biopsy did not show any specific pattern. The pathology study of cervical lymph node biopsy showed histological patterns of Hodgkin s disease as well as nodular sclerosis.","1. Hodgkin Lymphoma 2. Pulmonary Tuberculosis 3. Sarcoidosis 4.

"A 59-year-old female presented on June 25, 2008, with a painless mass in the left breast that had been present for one week and a fever with a temperature of 37.0-37.7oC. The patient exhibited no other symptoms or relevant past or family histories. A physical examination revealed a mobile mass in the left breast measuring 1.8x1.2 cm, with no palpable auxiliary lymph nodes.
Ultrasound revealed a solid and hypoechoic mass measuring 1.7x0.9 cm, which had a clear boundary with hypervascular flow, and the mammography showed an equidensity mass with no areas of calcification. The chest radiography revealed no abnormal observations, and abdominal ultrasound revealed no suspected lesions in the liver or spleen. The complete blood count showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2.9x109/l, a neutrocyte count of 0.2x109/l, hemoglobin levels of 109 g/l and a platelet (PLT) count of 104x109/l.
Since the mass in the patient's breast was considered to be a benign tumor, a lumpectomy had to be performed under local infiltration anesthesia. The patient underwent the lumpectomy on June 10, 2008, despite a relatively low WBC count. According to the frozen section, the patient was diagnosed with breast mucosa-associated B-cell lymphoma. Post-operative pathology revealed that the nuclei of the tumor cells were evidently different in size and shape and scattered among the massive fibrous tissue. At the edge of the tumor, the tumor cells exhibited a streamline alignment (Fig. 1A) and mitotic figures were easily identified. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that markers of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD45RA were positive and those for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), L26 and CD3 were negative, while CD45RO was weakly positive (Fig. 1B). The patient was confirmed with AML-M4E0 by bone marrow aspiration, and","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 2. Breast Mucosa-Associated Lymphoma 3.

"A 43-year-old male reported with a swelling in the lower jaw of 8 months' duration, in the mandibular symphysis region with no pain, trismus, or paresthesia associated with the swelling [Figure 1]. Examination revealed an ulcerated erythematous mass arising from the lower anterior alveolar region from canine to canine and obliterating the labial vestibule. The mass was hard in consistency, nontender, and seemed fixed to the mandible. Tongue movements were normal and the floor of the mouth was uninvolved. No regional lymphadenopathy was present. Metastasis was evaluated by ultrasonogram and computed tomography (CT) with negative results.
The mandibular basal bone appeared intact on orthopantomogram.
CT images revealed a well-circumscribed hypointense area of 3.3 cm x 3.3 cm x 2.9 cm in the symphysis region extending from the labial cortex into the soft tissue. Within this, patchy hyperintense areas were noted. There was thinning of the labial cortex with evidence of minimal cortical involvement in the symphysis region [Figure 2].
Taking into consideration the radiological appearance of intact basal bone and the low-grade nature confirmed histologically (incisional biopsy), plan was made for a marginal resection. Intraoperatively, the mass was well demarcated and firm in consistency. The labial alveolar bone was minimally invaded by the tumor. The cortical bone that bordered the lesion was clinically intact. Adequate clearance of 2.5 cm of bony and soft-tissue margin was given [Figure 3]. Postoperative histopathological evaluation revealed that the bony and soft-tissue margins were free of tumor cells. No complication has been reported in the 24-month follow-up. No additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy was given.
Biopsy specimen consisted of lobules of chondrocytes separated by thin fibromyxoid stroma. The chondrocytes show varying degrees of differentiation with areas of malignant cartilage production. Cords of tumor cells, mostly spindle shaped, were seen infiltrating the stroma. The cells in some areas showed atypia with hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitotic figures were identified easily [Figure 4].","1. Chondrosarcoma 2. Osteosarcoma 3. Ameloblastoma 4. Odontogenic myxoma 5. Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma"
"A 56-year-old female presented with an asymptomatic swelling of 15-year duration in the floor of the mouth and chin region that gradually increased in size.
Extraoral examination revealed a soft-to-firm nontender swelling in the left submental and submandibular region [Figure 1]. Left submandibular lymph node was of size 1 cm and nontender on palpation.
On intraoral examination, a localized, smooth, well-defined, nontender swelling approximately of size 4 cm x 2 cm in the floor of the mouth extending from 31 to 38 region was noticed [Figure 2]. Bi-digital palpation of the salivary gland revealed a blood-filled exudate through the ductal opening.
Mandibular occlusal radiograph and computed tomography scan showed flecks of calcifications medial to the left mandibular cortex [Figure 3] that suggested ""chronic sialadenitis secondary to sialolith."" As tumours from floor of the mouth could also obstruct submandibular duct and cause retro-obstructive sialadenitis, ultrasonogram was performed which showed the swelling was of salivary origin. The findings such as hypervascular masses with multifocal calcification and altered echotexture with nodal involvement [Figure 4] and also increased clear cell changes in incisional biopsy were more in favor of malignancy.
Under general anaesthesia, sublingual and submandibular salivary gland along with the associated nodes was excised through transoral approach with midline osteotomy [Figure 5].
The histopathology of the excised specimen revealed mucous cells, intermediate cells, and epidermoid cells with minimal cellular atypia arranged in lobules and sheath forms. Areas of cystic degeneration and stromal hyalinization with clear cell changes in the periphery and invasion into bone and muscle fibers were evident.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1.

"The patient was a woman in her 40s. An elevated lesion had been detected in the greater curvature at the fundus on screening upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. On conventional white-light endoscopy, no atrophic changes were seen in the background mucosa, and there was a regular arrangement of collecting venules (RAC). The serological findings indicated the absence of H. pylori infection. A distinct, glossy, reddish, nodular, elevated lesion was detected in the greater curvature of the gastric fundus with a whitish flat elevated area (Figure 1a). The margin of the lesion became clearer after indigo carmine dye spraying, and the lesion was approximately 25 mm in size. (Figure 1b). A clear demarcation line was visualised by magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (M-NBI). When the nodular elevation was observed using M-NBI according to the VS (vessel plus surface) classification system, an absent microvascular pattern plus an irregular microsurface pattern was observed. It was also accompanied by so-called vessels within an epithelial circle (VEC) pattern (Figure 1c). The flat elevated area was classed as a regular microvascular pattern plus a regular microsurface pattern (Figure 1d). Neither light blue crest nor white opaque substance, which are the markers for intestinal phenotype, was detected. Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with gastric phenotype in H. pylori negative was suspected. Histopathological examination of the resected specimens revealed that the background mucosa was histologically negative for H. pylori. The tumour was diagnosed as very well- to well-differentiated adenocarcinoma localised within the mucosa. The nodular part mainly consists of densely proliferating gland ducts of varying sizes and dilated ducts with interstitial oedema. Papillary structures were also seen at the tumour surface (Figure 2a). The tumour tissue consisted of pyloric gland-like tubular ducts. On immunostaining, the chief cell-like cells are negative for pepsinogen (Figure 2b), surface foveolar epithelium-like cells are positive for MUC5AC (Figure 2c) and pyloric gland-like cells are positive for MUC6 (Figure 2d) and lysozyme (Figure 2e).

"The second patient was a woman in her 60s. An elevated lesion had been detected on screening endoscopy. On conventional white-light endoscopy, no atrophic changes were seen in the background mucosa, and there was a RAC. The serological findings indicated the absence of H. pylori infection. A glossy, slightly reddish nodule measuring 8 mm in diameter was detected in the greater curvature of the gastric body (Figure 3a). M-NBI findings showed a regular MV pattern composed of loop-shaped microvessels and a regular MS pattern with a demarcation line (Figure 3b). Neither light blue crest nor white opaque substance, which are the markers for intestinal phenotype, was detected. From the endoscopic findings, it was difficult to determine whether the lesion was gastric cancer or adenoma. Histopathological examination of resected specimens demonstrated a very well- to well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with shallow submucosal invasion (400 mum). Lymphovascular invasion was not detected. The tumour consists of densely proliferating tumour ducts with a slightly atypical structure. Dilated tumour ducts are present in some parts (Figure 4a). On immunostaining, the chief cell-like cells are mainly positive for pepsinogen (Figure 4b), the foveolar epithelium-like cells are mainly positive for MUC5AC (Figure 4c). The mucous neck cell-like cells are mainly positive for MUC6; the pyloric gland-like cells are mainly positive for MUC6 (Figure 4d) and lysozyme (Figure 4e). Parietal cell-like cells are mainly positive for proton pumps (Figure 4f). All tumour cells were negative for MUC2 and CD10. Accordingly, the tumour has a gastric phenotype with differentiation into fundic gland, pyloric gland and foveolar epithelium.","1. Gastric Adenocarcinoma 2. Well-Differentiated Adenocarcinoma 3.

"A 73-year-old Japanese man whose only significant medical history included endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer in 2013 and 2014 visited our hospital because of abdominal pain, anemia, and melena in June 2015. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy revealed no bleeding sources other than the small intestine. Although his symptoms improved without treatment soon after visiting the hospital, he was admitted for further investigation of the cause of anemia and melena in February 2016.
Physical examination was unremarkable. There was no abdominal tenderness. A complete blood count and laboratory data, including tumor marker levels, were within normal limits. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was unremarkable. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) revealed some redness at the ileum. We performed oral and anal DBE in February 2016. Anal DBE showed the narrow opening of an extra lumen in the ileum about 100 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve (Fig. 1). The extra lumen was located on the mesenteric side of the ileum and had a blind end. The biopsy specimens obtained from the ileal duplication showed histologically normal small intestinal tissue. Enteroclysis via DBE using Gastrografin (diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution) (Nihon Schering, Osaka, Japan), a water-soluble iodinated radiopaque contrast medium, showed a 5-cm-long ileal diverticulum-like structure at the mesenteric side of the ileum (Fig. 2). Abdominal CT enteroclysis was performed immediately after DBE enteroclysis in order to confirm the shape and size (Fig. 3). No ectopic gastric mucosa was detected by technetium-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy. The patient was discharged soon after these unremarkable examinations.","1. Ileal duplication 2.

"A 59-year-old female was referred to our hospital with abnormal nodules in the spleen on abdominal ultrasonography during a routine health screening. Her past medical history included an abscess in the fallopian tube and bilateral ovaries 7 years ago. Baseline laboratory tests, including complete blood count, serum levels of electrolytes (including calcium), renal and liver function tests, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level, and levels of the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a normal-sized spleen with three small hypoechoic nodules of different dimensions. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen confirmed the presence of multiple lesions in the spleen. The three splenic nodules exhibited heterogeneous enhancement with a hypointense signal on T2-weighted images and measured 22, 17, and 9 mm in diameter (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). No other lesions were found in other organs.
The initial differential diagnosis included a fibrous hamartoma and an inflammatory pseudotumor, and a follow-up imaging was planned. An enhanced CT scan performed 4 months later revealed an increase in the diameters of all nodules to 27, 22, and 16 mm. Aberrant 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 2.89 was observed by positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, and the patient finally underwent diagnostic laparoscopic splenectomy.
The 4-trocar technique was used, and ligaments and vessels were dissected using a LigaSure  (Valleylab, Boulder, CO, USA) or by clipping. After full mobilization of the viscus, the splenic artery was exposed until the peripheral parts, and the peripheral artery to the pancreas (pancreatic tail artery) was preserved. The spleen was removed through a small 3-cm opening in the umbilical region. There was no significant bleeding, and the total surgery time was 148 min. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day 5 with adequate oral intake, normal vital signs, and no complaints.
Gross examination revealed that the resected spleen contained poorly demarcated, white nodules (Fig. 3). Histopathological examination showed splenic parenchyma with discrete, round to oval noncaseating granulomas comprising epithelioid granulomas, multinucleated giant cells, and asteroid inclusion bodies (Fig. 4).

"An 86-year-old man with a history of nasal bone fracture, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and diabetes mellitus presented with a left nasal mass incidentally found on an MRI of the brain (Fig. 4, Table 1). He reported rhinorrhea, and results of a physical examination revealed septal perforation and a large mass emerging from the left middle turbinate region. A CT showed a solid, well-circumscribed lesion (2.6 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm) that seemed to erode the middle turbinate, obliterate the left middle meatus, extend into the ethmoid air cells, and erode the left lamina papyracea (Fig. 5, Table 1). Although, generally, one would suspect malignancy to be more heterogeneous with less well-defined borders, in this case, radiologists suspected a neoplasm, including adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Middle turbinate cultures showed Escherichia coli and mixed skin flora with white blood cells. With the patient under local anesthesia, the mass was surgically drained and the anterior ethmoid chamber was opened, which revealed a thick yellow-green mucus discharge.","1. Nasal adenocarcinoma 2.

"A 64-year-old man presented with a history of multiple asymptomatic plaques and nodules on his scalp for 9 years. He reported that multiple pruritic papules had first been observed 9 years earlier. The papules and plaques gradually grew to approximately 6 cm x 7 cm in size. The tumor was excised at another hospital in 2014, and the diagnosis was ""scar"". Seven months before, multiple nodules had formed on the scalp, and the lesion rapidly invaded the left forehead. Moreover, a mass was also observed on the ipsilateral neck (Figure 1). There were no systemic symptoms or other underlying diseases, including skin disorders. He had no family history of the disease.
Physical examination revealed multiple interfused reddish, tender plaques and nodules, which were 12 cm x 10 cm in size on his scalp (Figure 2A). The lesions had a 1 cm x 1 cm ulceration in the center (Figure 2B). Moreover, there was a skin-colored mass on the ipsilateral neck, which was 3 cm x 3 cm in size. The systematic physical examination showed no abnormalities. Laboratory tests including blood cell counts, urea, and liver function were normal. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was also normal. Magnetic resonance imaging found that the forehead was unevenly thickened and hardened, and there was an irregular soft tissue shadow on the left posterior cervical area that may have been neoplastic lesions (Figure 2C). Incisional biopsies of a nodule and a plaque on the left scalp and an incisional biopsy of the mass on the ipsilateral neck were taken and sent for histopathological examination.
Histologically, the nodule was a classic presentation of TC, whereas the plaque and the mass on the neck presented with some cable-like structures, which looked like sweat glands in the dermis of the lesion and may even have invaded from the dermis to the subcutaneous fat (Figure 3).

There was history of fever off and on and 10% weight loss. On examination a firm, tender swelling, 10 x 8cm in size was seen over left scapular region with dilated veins on the surface. Local temperature was not raised. The skin was intact.
The investigations showed hemoglobin 6.8 g% and raised total white cell count as 16, 200 cells/cu.mm. Differential count showed neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 20%, eosinophils 4% and monocytes 1%. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 70 mm in the first hour. X-ray revealed a large lytic lesion in the left scapula, without soft tissue extension [Figure 1]. The X-ray chest showed hyperinflated lungs and bronchiectatic changes in both lungs. An abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormality.
Fine needle aspiration cytology revealed cells arranged in small groups against a hemorrhagic background. The cells were large, about 60 mu, with well-defined borders, abundant dense eosinophilic cytoplasm, pleomorphic nuclei with high N/C ratio and prominent nucleoli [Figure 2]. Occasional multinucleated tumor giant cells were also observed. The cytological findings led to a provisional diagnosis of an osteogenic sarcoma, vs. a metastatic adenocarcinoma.
The surgical biopsy specimen consisted of haemorrhagic, creamish-white tissue pieces, of aggregate 2cm. Formalin - fixed Haematoxylin and Eosin stained sections showed round to polyhedral cells arranged in the form of trabeculae, cell balls and pseudoglands separated by fine vascularized septa [Figure 3]. The nuclei were pleomorphic with large nucleoli and intranuclear inclusions. The cytoplasm was eosinophilic, granular and finely vacuolated. Mitotic activity was low (1-2/10 hpf).
The impression was that of a malignant paraganglioma with the differential diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma,. A Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was carried out and additional immunostaining for Chromogranin, Synaptophysin, S-100 protein, AE-1/AE-3, and Cytokeratins (CK) 7 and 20 was performed.
The results were very interesting. The PAS stain was weakly positive in some cells in the cytoplasm and also in lumina. The Chromogranin, Synaptophysin and S-100 stains were negative. The AE-1/AE-3 and CK-7 stains were strongly positive, while CK-20 was negative [Figures 4a,b].","Paraganglioma Metastatic Adenocarcinoma Osteogenic Sarcoma Chondrosarcoma Multiple Myeloma"
"A 57-year-old female lady presented with complaint of sudden onset of urinary incontinence for 3 days duration. Further, history taking reveals that she has been having radiculopathy pain and bilateral lower limb weakness for a year duration. Clinical examination reveals that bilateral lower limb hypotonia, bilateral lower limb motor power of Medical Research Council (MRC) Grade 2, and bilateral lower limb reflexes were absent and sensory reduced from T11 dermatome onward.
Magnetic resonance imaging reveals a heterogeneous lobulated mass in the spinal canal at T11 and T12 level, compressing and displacing the conus medullary superiorly and to the right (Fig. 1 and 2). She underwent laminectomy of T11 and T12 with microscopic assisted excision of the tumor. The mass was located intradural extramedullary and was successfully removed completely; however, the nerve root had to be sacrificed (Fig. 3 and 4).
At post-operative day 1, the radiculopathy pain resolved. She regained bladder control at the 1st week post-operative. She was ambulating with aid at 2 weeks post-operative and by 2 months, she was able to walk unaided. There was no detectable post-operative neurological deficit despite sacrificing the involved nerve root.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Spinal Cord Compression 2.

"A 64-year-old male presented with a progressive T4-level paraparesis characterized by progressive numbness below the waistline, weakness in both lower extremities, and ataxia of gait. His neurological examination showed diffuse 4/5 bilateral lower extremity weakness with a relative T4-sensory level to pin appreciation.
The thoracic MRI revealed a large right-sided dorsal intradural extramedullary lesion contributing to severe compression of the spinal cord at T4-level. The CT scan confirmed the lesion was hyperdense, consisting of intratumoral ossification [Figure 1]. The predominant differential diagnoses included ossified meningioma versus schwannoma.
Under neuromonitoring and following a T4-T5 laminectomy, a midline durotomy was performed. This revealed an intradural extramedullary tumor with a base adherent to the right lateral dura. The tumor was dissected off the dura allowing for gross total resection (GTR); the sensory rootlets enmeshed in the tumor capsule were easily dissected off the lesion and preserved. A watertight closure followed, and there were no intraoperative neuromonitoring changes. Within 6 postoperative months, the patient was neurologically intact except for some mild residual gait ataxia, (i.e. requiring a cane to ambulate).
Gross pathology showed the lesion was irregular, tan, and rubbery, measuring 9 x 10 x 13 mm. On microscopy, there were meningothelial cells with oval to spindle-shaped nuclei containing occasional intranuclear pseudoinclusions. Frequent swirls of psammoma bodies were also seen. Additional areas showed more extensive ""ossification"" (i.e. bone formation, osseous metaplasia). As the tumor showed little mitotic activity, and there were no areas of hypercellularity,","1.

"A 48-year-old male patient presented with 1 year's duration of progressive right-sided neck pain, a right C6 radiculopathy, and eventually a right > left spastic quadriparesis. The MRI revealed a destructive lesion involving the C3-C5 vertebra with an epidural collection. The original diagnosis was Potts disease (radiological diagnosis alone), and anti-tubercular drugs were utilized for 3 months. He finally developed a spastic quadriplegia with bladder involvement, leading to a contrast enhanced cervical MRI (CEMRI) and holospinal - CT. When these studies confirmed a destructive C3-5 lesion with an epidural collection, unchanged from prior study, the patient underwent an anterior C3, C4 (complete), and C5 (partial) corpectomy/fusion using an expandable cage [Figure 1a-d].
The histopathology showed diffuse sheets of large atypical oval to polygonal cells admixed with lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, plasma cells, and histiocytes. The tumor cells showed oval to horseshoe shaped nuclei, coarse chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and moderate amount of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Immunohistochemistry showed tumor cells to be positive for CD3, CD4, CD7, CD8, CD30, and CD43 and negative for ALK-1, CD15, CD68, CD20, CD79a, CK, CD1A, and S-100; Ki-67 index of tumor cells was 20% [Figures 2 and 3].
For staging, a CECT scan of the neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, with bone marrow biopsy, CSF study with cytospin, and 99mTc-MDP bone scan were performed. The bone scan showed focal involvement at the operative site but there was no evidence of marrow involvement with lymphoma.","1. Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma 2. Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma 3.

"A 48-year-old Samoan man underwent a colonoscopy and endoscopy to evaluate a history of chronic diarrhea and recent significant weight loss of >20 kilograms. His past medical history was significant for recurrent polyarticular gout for >7 years, which had caused significant physical impairment. On clinical examination his weight was 84 kg (body mass index, 25 kg/m2). Inspection of the hands revealed swelling and enlargement of the proximal interphalangeal joints, and a gouty tophus was visible on the tragus of the right ear. The systemic examination was otherwise normal.
Biochemical analysis showed mild anemia (124 g/L) and leukocytosis (12.7 x 109/L) with lymphocytosis (5.75 x 109/L). C-reactive protein was elevated at 71 mg/L. Liver function tests showed elevated alkaline phosphotase (351 U/L) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (277 U/L) with hypoalbuminemia (25 g/L). The urate level was 0.68 mmol/L, and microbiological investigations of stool samples were negative. A joint aspiration showed negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals with sterile cultures. A liver ultrasound was normal.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy identified gastric mucosal atrophy and blunted villi in the duodenum (Figure 1). Duodenal mucosal biopsies showed preserved villous architecture with some deposition of eosinophilic material within the lamina propria and vessel walls. The eosinophilic material stained positive with Congo red (Figure 2). A colonoscopy was macroscopically normal. Biopsies from the terminal ileum showed mild villous blunting, fibrosis of submucosa, and eosinophilic material that stained positive with Congo red within the lamina propria and vessel walls. Immunohistochemistry of duodenal and terminal ileum sections tested positive for serum AA protein. Kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chain and transthyretin immunohistochemical stains were negative. Proteomic analysis demonstrated the amyloid deposits to be comprised of serum amyloid A (SAA)-2 protein.
The results were consistent with a diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. A search for additional causes of secondary amyloidosis failed to identify any other immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or chronic infections including tuberculosis. Thus,","1.

"A 66-year-old man underwent investigation for persistent anorexia and fatigue which had persisted for one month. On his past history and family history, there was nothing noteworthy, including no evidence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type1or von Hippel-Lindau disease. And he was not a smoker or a drinker. On his occupational history, he had not worked in printing industry where incidence of the bile duct carcinoma is known to be high. On his physical examination, the bulbar conjunctiva was yellow. Laboratory tests showed that the values of hepatobiliary enzymes were increased (T-Bil was 8.9 mg/dl, D-Bil was 5.6 mg/dl, AST was 377 U/L, ALT was 653 U/L, ALP was 1105 U/l, and gamma-GTP was 2291 U/l). CEA and CA19-9 were within normal limits. On abdominopelvic contrast-enhanced CT, an enhancing 10 mm x 8 mm hypervascular tumor was observed in the distal bile duct and the proximal bile duct was markedly dilated (Fig. 1). MRCP demonstrated a filling defect spanning 10 mm in the maximal diameter in the distal bile duct with markedly dilatation of the proximal bile duct. There was no evidence of pancreatobiliary maljunction (Fig. 2). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) also showed a stenosis of 10 mm in the maximal diameter was observed in the distal bile duct (Fig. 3). Examination of a biopsy specimen obtained from the narrow site of the bile duct at the time of ERC revealed moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. With a preoperative diagnosis of distal bile duct cancer, pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. On surgical findings, a median incision was made in the upper abdomen and observation of the abdominal cavity did not reveal tumor dissemination or liver metastasis. The tumor was palpable as an induration in the distal bile duct. Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (Child II-A) was performed. The operating time was 343 min and blood loss was 533 mlMacroscopic findings (Fig. 4) shows a white nodular infiltrating tumor of 10 mm in the maximal diameter was observed in the distal bile duct. Histopathological findings (Fig. 5) shows the tumor composed of cells in solid clusters and cells forming tubular structures with abundant fibrous stroma. The solid clustered cells were positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin -A in immunohistochemistry, which indicated neuroendocrine differentiation. The cells also showed numerous mitoses and high-Ki-67 labeling index (25 mitotic figures/10 HPF; 30% Ki-67-positive). The proportion of each component was at least 30%.","1.

"A 40-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with abnormal findings on chest X-ray. Her medical history was remarkable in that she had had a pleomorphic adenoma in the right parotid gland treated with enucleation in our hospital approximately 12 years prior. That tumor had been 3.6x3.2 cm in diameter, and while partial extracapsular growth and invasion of the capsular blood vessels were observed, there had been no cervical lymph node metastasis.
A chest X-ray revealed bilateral multiple nodules (Fig. 1). A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed well-defined non-calcified nodular lesions of the bilateral lobes, with a maximum diameter of 11 mm (Fig. 2). 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed slightly positive signals (SUVmax: 1.0) in multiple lung nodules. For a diagnosis, two nodules of the right upper lobe and one nodule of the right median lobe were partially resected by thoracoscopy. A macroscopic examination showed well-demarcated whitish solid masses with surfaces that were not smooth. A histological examination showed that the tumors contained a central epithelial component with proliferating polygonal or fusiform epithelial cells without nuclear atypia, and a peripheral mesenchymal component with loose fusiform cells in a myxoid stroma. In the surgical specimen of the parotid gland obtained 12 years previously, the tumor cells exhibited vascular and subcapsular invasion. These pathological findings were highly similar to the current findings, and thus the tumors were considered to have the same origin (Fig. 3).
An immunohistochemical analysis was positive for pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and S-100 protein in the epithelial cells. The mesenchymal cells were negative for AE1/AE3 and positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the border zone between the epithelial and mesenchymal cells (Fig. 4).

"A 72-year-old-woman was admitted to the emergency department for uremic syndrome, hemodynamic instability and chronic abdominal pain associated with constipation for 2 weeks. She had a history of nephrectomy and chronic renal failure without replacement therapy of renal function and hypertension. She was treated with telmisartan-hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine and furosemide.
Three weeks before the current admission she was on treatment for hyperkalemia with calcium polystyrene sulfonate PO 29.92 g daily.
At the emergency department she was treated with polyethylene glycol powder for oral solution 4 l at conventional dilution, and rectal enemas with buffered sodium phosphate solution for constipation treatment.
She was admitted to the ICU with metabolic acidosis and uremia exacerbation requiring hemodialysis in the next 48 h.
One day after the admission to the ICU the abdominal distension augmented. Abdominal CT shows free intraperitoneal air consistent with colonic perforation (Fig. 1).
The patient went to exploratory laparotomy where a perforation at the sigmoid colon was found (Fig. 2). A Hartmann procedure was performed and open abdomen protocol was initiated with Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy with ABThera (KCI) in the need for a ""second look"" surgery. Forty-eight hours later, the rectal stump was found necrotic and a rectal resection on the superior third of rectum was perfomed.
Microscopically examination revealed areas of transmural necrosis in sigmoid colon and rectal stump of heterogeneous distribution and acute peritonitis with small basophilic angulated crystals embedded in the mucosa (Fig. 3). There was no evidence of recent vascular thrombosis.","1. Colonic Perforation 2. Sigmoid Colon Necrosis 3. Rectal Stump Necrosis 4. Acute Peritonitis 5. Calcium Polystyrene Sulfonate Toxicity"
"A 52-year-old male presented with complaints of straining during micturition for two years, with poor stream of urine and burning micturition on and off. There was no history of hematuria, pyuria or retention of urine. Systemic systems were not present. On examination, suprapubic lump was palpable, more on the right side. On cystoscopy, a large solid tumor arising from just above the bladder neck along the right lateral wall, going anteriorly was seen. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large encapsulated intravesical mass [Figure 1]. There was no obvious extravesical extension. The radiological features were suggestive of a benign etiology, which could represent a mesenchymal tumor. Needle biopsy was performed followed by excision of the tumor. During surgery, an infraumbilical midline incision was taken, with an extraperitoneal approach. The tumor was palpated and bladder opened just lateral to the tumor on the anterior surface. Mucosa over the tumor was incised and a plane was developed. The tumor was freed from all mucosal attachments and enucleated. Pedicle of the tumor was transfixed and tumor was delivered.
Histology of the biopsy revealed a neoplasm composed of neoplastic cells with uniform oval to spindled nuclei arranged in a striking storiform pattern [Figure 2]. There was no evidence of necrosis, mitotic activity or nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical stain with vimentin was strongly positive. Cytokeratin, smooth muscle actin, S-100 and desmin was negative. A diagnosis of a mesenchymal tumor, possibly benign was offered at this stage, since th amount of tissue studied was small. Subsequently, the excised specimen was received. Grossly, the tumor measured 13 x 10 x 9 cm and weighed 600g [Figure 3]. It was well circumscribed with a smooth surface. Cut surface showed a firm, nodular, yellowish white appearance. Histology revealed features as seen in the needle biopsy specimen.

"A previously healthy 48-year-old Japanese woman presented to the emergency department with severe pain in her dominant right hand and wrist. She worked as an office assistant but denied any blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand. She did not take any medications and had no animal contact. Fifteen hours prior, she described the gradual onset of a tingling sensation at the tips of the fingers along with mild clumsiness in her hand. She tried loxoprofen (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) without any improvement in her symptoms.
On an examination, her vital signs were normal, and the hand was noted to be held in a partially flexed position at the wrist (Fig. 1). The skin of the volar aspect of the right wrist appeared red and edematous. The radial and ulnar artery pulses were palpable, and the capillary refill time was normal. A neurological examination revealed subjective hypoesthesia in all five fingers with positive Tinel and Phalen tests. Plain wrist radiographs were unremarkable, but an unenhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the wrist demonstrated edematous changes around the digital flexor tendons within the wrist (Fig. 2). Laboratory studies were consistent with an acute infectious or inflammatory process with a white blood cell count of 11,000/muL with 87% neutrophils. Over the ensuing two hours, the patient's pain and edema rapidly worsened, and the erythema began to extend up her arm. Due to the rapid progression and pain out of proportion, an emergent surgical consultation was obtained for possible necrotizing fasciitis. In addition to necrotizing fasciitis, the surgery team was also concerned about pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, and she was taken promptly to the operating room.
The intraoperative findings revealed a blood-stained purulent exudate as well as edematous changes within the common flexor tendon sheath (ulnar bursa) with secondary median nerve compression but no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis. The ulnar bursa was incised, debrided, and irrigated with saline and an external drainage catheter was placed. Two sets of blood cultures failed to grow any organisms, but a Gram stain of the exudate showed the presence of Gram-positive cocci, subsequently identified as penicillin-resistant but methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Preoperatively, she received meropenem, vancomycin and clindamycin and the antibiotic coverage was narrowed to first-generation cephalosporin based on the microbiological susceptibility pattern. She had an uncomplicated postoperative course, and antibiotic treatment was continued for 20 days. At her two-month follow-up, she had almost completely regained the motor and sensory function in the hand.","1. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis 2. Necrotizing fasciitis 3.

"A 38-year-old woman presented with a painless midline neck mass for 3 years. She had no associated symptoms and no history of previous neck irradiation. She was clinically euthyroid. Examination revealed a 2 x 2 cm cystic mass in the thyrohyoid area. The palpable thyroid gland was unremarkable. Preoperative ultrasound revealed a 1.8 x 2.4 cm cystic mass with septation and a solid mural component with microcalcification (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). A 4 mm right thyroid nodule was also detected (Fig. 3) and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. A fine needle aspiration biopsy without imaging guidance was carried out and yielded a nondiagnostic result. Sistrunk's operation was performed and the pathological report was a 1.4 cm papillary thyroid carcinoma in the benign cyst. A primary carcinoma arising in the TGDC is suggestive due to the presence of a thick fibrous wall with squamous epithelium and normal follicular cells. Lymphovascular invasion and a close surgical margin were reported. The patient was informed for a total thyroidectomy due to the pathological results and the right lobe lesion. Pathological report of the thyroid was a 4 mm papillary carcinoma with partial invasion through the thyroid capsule of the right lobe with a second 1 mm papillary carcinoma at the isthmus.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1.

"A 32-year-old female presented to our hospital with a tumor on the left lumbar region. She had no personal or family history of skin cancer. The lesion of concern was an erythematous and focal eccentric pigmented nodule of 15 mm in diameter (fig. 1a). The clinical appearance of the lesion raised a suspicion of malignancy, and surgical resection was performed.
The surgically resected specimen showed a nodule with focally pigmented areas, and the cut surface of the nodule was asymmetrical and not ulcerated. Histological examinations showed a skin fragment with nearly complete effacement by foamy cells and asymmetry (fig. 1b). The foamy cells in the superficial dermis extended to the fatty tissue to a depth of 10 mm. Nuclear atypia and mitosis were scarcely displayed (fig. 1c). The intraepidermal component was composed of both nested and single atypical melanocytes with areas of intraepidermal pagetoid spread (fig. 1d). Fontana-Masson staining of the balloon cell component was negative (fig. 2a). An immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the balloon cells were positive with HMB-45 (fig. 2b) and S-100 protein (fig. 2c) and negative with cytokeratin. Staining with Ki-67 was positive in almost 44% of the foamy cells (fig. 2d). The pathological diagnosis was of BCMM (Breslow depth 10 mm, Clark level V) without ulcer.
A month after the excision, the patient presented with enlarged bilateral inguinal lymph nodes. The excised bilateral inguinal lymph nodes showed diffuse replacement of the lymph nodes by foamy cells (fig. 1e, f). These cells resembled those of the primary lesion. The diagnosis of a metastatic BCMM in bilateral inguinal lymph nodes was made.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Balloon Cell Melanoma 2. Metastatic Melanoma 3. Malignant Tumor 4.

"An 8 years old, neutered male mixed breed dog was evaluated for a 3 days history of cervical hyperpathia and right hemiparesis that progressed to tetraplegia. Upon presentation, the dog was tetraplegic with absent postural reactions in all limbs, diminished muscle tone and hyporeflexia in the thoracic limbs, and pelvic limb spasticity and hyperreflexia. Cervical hyperpathia was apparent on flexion of the neck. The neuroanatomic diagnosis was C6-T2 myelopathy.
An MRI of the cervical spine was performed under general anesthesia, the results of which were consistent with C5-C6 IVDH with associated compressive extradural hemorrhage (Figures 2A,B). No abnormal changes were observed within the spinal cord parenchyma. Ventral slot decompression was performed at C5-C6. The dog was ambulatory with pelvic limb ataxia when it was discharged to the owner 3 days after surgery.
Seven days after surgery, the dog represented non-ambulatory with severe lower motor neuron paresis and muscle atrophy in the thoracic limbs, with the pelvic limbs being neurologically intact. A cervical MRI examination was repeated and complete resolution of the previously identified extradural compression at C5-C6 was noted. However, contrast-enhancing ISC with an SEM-like phenotype was observed (Figures 2C-F), and subacute reperfusion injury, intramedullary hemorrhage, edema, myelitis, or infarction considered possible etiologies for the imaging abnormalities. Lumbar CSF analysis revealed albuminocytologic dissociation (total protein 101 mg/dl; reference range <45 mg/dl). CBC, indirect blood pressure, buccal mucosal bleeding time, and coagulation profile were within reference ranges. The dog underwent physical therapy and treatment with prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/day PO for 10 days) but remained non-ambulatory. Thoracic limb motor function and muscle mass declined insidiously and the dog was euthanized and a necropsy performed 3 months after surgery. Pathological findings in the gray matter were similar to those described for Case 1, except that at the junction of the ventral and intermediate gray horns with white matter, vacuolization of the white matter associated with variable axonal swelling was observed (Figure 2G).","1.

"A 47-year-old woman referred to our center with a history of gradually worsening symptoms of headache, diplopia, and left-sided ptosis (eyelid drooping) for 1 year ago that has progressed intensely during the past 4 months.
Magnetic resonance imagining that performed in another center revealed a localized midbrain lesion and referred to our center 9 months after her initial symptoms.
The neurological examination revealed left eye hypotropia and ptosis. The medial and upward gaze of the left eye was impaired and deviated slightly out and down in the primary position [Figure 1]. The pupil was unreactive and mildly dilated compare to the right eye. The rest of the physical examinations showed no significant findings.
Multiplanar images at different MRI sequences with and without intravenous contrast showed small spherical tumor (10 x 5 x 5 mm) abutting anterolateral of the left cerebral peduncle. The tumor appeared isointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Imaging confirmed a gadolinium-enhanced mass with no dural attachment, suggesting for Schwannoma [Figure 2].
After general anesthesia, lateral subfrontal craniotomy was performed. Dura opened on curly Lina Fashion. The carotid artery was found. By opening the liliequist membrane, the posterior communicating artery was followed to the interpeduncular fossa. Firm dark pink global tumor with a compressive effect on the mesencephalic area appeared. The third nerve ran into the tumor [Figure 3a]. Attempts to separate the tumor from the nerve were seemingly impossible because the tumor was adhesive and appeared to be rising from the oculomotor nerve. Complete paralysis of the third nerve on preoperative examinations indicated neural, and tumor fibers had been intertwined. Therefore, the surgeon considered the complete resection of the tumor as the best option for the patient and the tumor, together with the involved part of the oculomotor nerve, was resected [Figure 3b].
The histopathological study of the 10 x 5 x 4 mm dark pink mass revealed round to oval centrally located nuclei with dispersed chromatin and eosinophilic cytoplasmic. Lobules of the tumor are separated from each other with collagen sheets and contained whorls and psammoma bodies. Necrosis was not a feature.","1. Oculomotor Nerve Schwannoma 2. Midbrain Tumor 3.

"A 56-year-old man receiving prednisone for Wegener's granulomatosis presented with fever, confusion, and progressive weakness. Wegener's granulomatosis had been previously diagnosed with a temporal artery biopsy, which demonstrated neutrophilic infiltration of the vessel wall consistent with a necrotizing vasculitis. Serum studies and CSF (titer 1:4096) were positive for Cryptococcus neoformans with a normal opening pressure. Cytology and flow cytometry were negative for B cells, plasma cells, or malignant cells. The patient was treated with ambisone and flucytosine initially. He also had cavitating lesions in the lung, spleen, and liver consistent with disseminated cryptococcal infection.
For the next six to seven months, the patient was re-admitted to the hospital repeatedly due to intermittent recurring headaches. Serial MRIs demonstrated progressive development of new lesions in the basal ganglia, ventriculitis, and worsening leptomeningitis with associated cerebritis. The patient was weaned off prednisone. His persistent symptoms were thought to be due to immune reconstitution syndrome, given the combination of worsening imaging features and elevated lumbar-puncture opening pressure, in the setting of reduced CSF cryptococcal antigen and negative CSF cultures. He subsequently changed to fluconazole for treatment of his cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.
MRI with contrast (Fig. 1) obtained approximately seven months after first presentation demonstrated a nodular mass with meningeal enhancement and parenchymal edema adjacent to the right MCA trifurcation, and a slightly more medial mass adjacent to the left MCA. There was high-grade vessel narrowing seen on MRA (Fig. 2) in both vessels at the precise location of the enhancement. Moderate irregularity of the left proximal A1 segment, which was also involved with inflammatory disease, was also noted on the MRA. Abnormal enhancement of the ependyma and choroid plexi was present. No infarct was seen on DWI.

One year ago, the patient was diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer at a local hospital due to painless hematuria and underwent TURBT, followed by one cycle of first-line therapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin). The patient ceased chemotherapy due to adverse reactions to the drugs. On April 2, 2021, he presented at our hospital with a recurrence of painless hematuria, and a biopsy confirmed bladder cancer recurrence ( Figure 2A ). Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the expression of PD-L1 as well ( Figure 2B ), and wild-type FGFR3 was discovered by NGS. The patient underwent abdominal enhanced CT ( Figure 2C ), chest CT ( Figure 2D ), and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure F), which revealed several oval nodules of varying sizes and a maximum diameter of 1.7 cm in both lungs, as well as a round soft tissue density shadow (5.4 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm) toward the base of the bladder.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1.

"A 25-year-old female came to our institution after noticing a rapid growing mass in her left breast for 16 weeks. She had no past medical histories and was at the week 25 of her first pregnancy. On examination, the patient was afebrile and there were two large masses on her left breast with diameters of 20 x 7 cm and 10 x 6 cm, which was ulcerated and bleeding (Fig. 1). A relatively fixed 2-cm lymph node in the left axilla was also noticed. On ultrasound, there were two heterogeneously echogenic lesions with irregular borders and fatty infiltrate, of which the diameters were about 10 cm and 20 cm respectively. Besides, several axillary lymph node with the largest diameter of 2 cm were found, but the fatty hilum was still present. The patient was anemic, with a hemoglobin level of 58 g/L.
Local dressing and pressure were applied to slow down the bleeding. Blood transfusion and prophylactic antibiotics were also indicated. The initial clinical diagnosis was cT4bN2M0 breast cancer. However, an open biopsy with local anesthesia was done which yielded the result of lactating adenoma of the breast. The tumor still significantly bled and palliative mastectomy was performed. During surgery, we found two large tumors which had unclear borders and spread to almost entire breast tissue but did not invade the pectoralis muscles.
On post-operative pathological examination, there were necrosis areas along with breast ductal hyperplasia. The epithelial cells exhibited secretory changes which had mildly hyperchromatic, round nuclei and prominent cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig. 2).","1. Lactating adenoma of the breast 2.

"An 11-year-old white female patient was referred to the Stomatology clinic of the University of Sao Paulo, because of a painless nodular lesion on the palatal gingiva close to the incisive papilla. The nodule was sessile, smooth-surfaced, covered with normal colored mucosa, firm upon palpation and measured approximately 1.5 cm (Figure 1).
The patient reported that the lesion had grown slowly over 2 years. The clinical hypothesis included peripheral ossifying fibroma and peripheral giant cell granuloma, and the patient was submitted to an excisional biopsy. The absence of bone erosion was confirmed through radiographic examination and during surgery.
In the course of gross examination, a hard consistency was noticed and the specimen was sent to be decalcified. The microscopic analysis revealed the presence of a rounded lesion within the lamina propria composed of randomly arranged dental tissues (Figure 2A). The tissues were mostly young, and composed of tubular dentin, cementum-like material and loosely arranged mesenchymal cells resembling dental papilla. The mass contained odontoblast-like cells adjacent to the dentin, small islands of odontogenic epithelium and few basophilic areas interpreted as enamel matrix. Foci of ghost cells were also observed (Figure 2B).","1. Odontoma 2. Peripheral Ossifying Fibroma 3. Compound Odontoma 4. Complex Odontoma 5. Hamartomatous Odontogenic Lesion"
"A 67-year-old woman presented with jaundice and fatigue. She had a 20-mm cyst in the pancreas that had been identified 12 years prior. She underwent CT scan each year since, and the cyst had not changed significantly. A laboratory examination revealed increased levels of bilirubin and hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH, gammaGTP, and ALP). Her serum amylase levels were not elevated. Her CA19-9 levels were slightly elevated, but other tumor markers, such as CEA and AFP, were within normal levels. A CT scan showed another 18-mm solid mass in the pancreatic head that obstructed the common bile duct, and the main pancreatic duct was dilated (Fig. 1). The cyst in the pancreatic body was connected to the pancreatic duct and had grown to 35 mm. Ultrasonography showed that the cyst contained a mural node; intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma was suspected (Fig. 2). The patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; a biopsy of the pancreatic head mass revealed the possibility of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. After biliary drainage, pancreatoduodenectomy was performed, and the cyst within the pancreatic body was resected together with the tumor. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful.
A histopathological examination of the specimen confirmed that the solid mass in the pancreatic head was a well tomoderately differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 30 mm. Vascular invasion and direct infiltration into a lymph node were observed, but lymph node metastasis was not detected. The pathological stage was T3 N1 M0 stage III according to the General Rules for the Study of Pancreatic Cancer (seventh edition) in Japan. In contrast, a 25-mm cystic mass was observed in the pancreatic body (Fig. 3). The wall of the cyst consisted of two components (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The inside of the cyst was lined with glandular structures containing large irregular nuclei and prominent nucleoli in the mucous cells that stained positive for CEA. The other component was represented by outer solid islands consisting of nests of small, uniform cells with round to oval nuclei thatstained negative for CEA and were immunoreactive for synaptophysin and chromogranin A. The Ki-67 index of this region was less than 2%, corresponding to NET G1.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma 2.

"A 75-year-old female patient had a history of appendicectomy. Following blunt abdominal injury she was admitted due to lack of bowel movements, abdominal cramps, pain, distension and vomiting. Ileus of the small bowels was established as the underlying cause of her complaints and urgent operation was performed. During abdominal exploration adhesions were found on an approximately, 15 cm section of the terminal ileum and adhesiolysis was carried out. During the operation, Meckel's diverticulum without any sign of inflammation was found and wedge excision was performed. No ectopic tissue could be palpated intraoperatively. Patient passed a smooth post-operative period and the bowel movements returned post-operatively and she was discharged with no complaints.
Pathological work-up of the resected Meckel's diverticulum revealed ectopic tissue in addition to the small bowel, mucosa and gastric glands were found. However, a well-circumscribed lesion of 0.5 cm was also detected that was well-distinguishable from the adjacent tissues. It infiltrated the muscle layer of the bowel, but no further layers were involved. The round, cuboidal cells built up nests and fascicles in the involved area. The nuclei were centrally located the chromatin was finely granulated. Immunohistochemical studies were also performed that proved the suspected diagnosis of carcinoid tumor. They were positive for synaptophysin, but negative for chromogranine, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK20. No vascular or lymphatic invasion was found and no abnormal lymph node could be detected.","1.

"A 37-year-old man underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy screening, incidentally revealing a gastric submucosal tumor. Two years later, the patient was referred to our institution for diagnosis.
Laboratory findings and tumor markers were within normal levels (cancer embryonic antigen 1.1 ng/ml, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 < 2.0 U/ml). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy findings from the previous physician reported a lesion in the fornix, which was reported to be less than approximately 2 cm (Figure 1a). Our institution showed that the tumor was approximately 2 cm long and had increased in thickness, with a reddish mucosal surface and central depression (Figure 1b). Narrow-band imaging with magnifying endoscopy did not reveal any cancerous characteristics of the mucosa. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a 1.9 cm lesion with poor vascularity in the fourth layer of the gastric wall (Figure 1c). Computed tomography showed no lymph nodes or metastases (Figure 1d). A boring biopsy of the tumor provided a specimen positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) in the proliferating spindle-shaped cells. Therefore, the lesion was diagnosed as a leiomyoma, but surgery was performed for a reliable diagnosis for en bloc resection.
Intra-abdominal observations revealed that the tumor was present on the greater curvature/anterior wall of the fornix and had angiogenesis on the serosa. During partial resection of the stomach using the NEWS method (Figure 2a-d), the tumor margins were identified. The resection line was accurately determined by placing markings both endoscopically and laparoscopically. The tumor was patently inverted into the gastric lumen, followed by an en-bloc resection and transoral retrieval. The operative time was 229 min, including endoscopic observation time. The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 7 without complications, and no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis was observed four years postoperatively.
Macroscopically, the tumor was 2.5 x 2.2 cm in diameter, with a sufficient normal gastric wall tissue margin (Figure 3a). Pathologically, the tumor had an infiltrative growth pattern with spindle-shaped cells growing in a cord-like pattern and round cells with basophilic cytoplasm (Figure 3b,c). Immunohistochemical staining revealed spindle-shaped cells positive for SMA and negative for c-kit, whereas the round cells, positive for CD38 and CD138, were identified as plasma cells. Thus,","1.

"A 52-year-old male presented with 2 weeks of a progressive quadriparesis (i.e. loss of dexterity in both hands and lower extremity weakness) and urinary incontinence. He also had cervical lymphadenopathy (i.e. anterior/posterior and post-auricular lymph nodes). On exam, he had 4/5 weakness in both lower extremities, diffuse lower extremity hyper-reflexia with bilateral Babinski responses, and a T2 sensory level (mJOA-10/18).
The X-rays and CT scan revealed a destructive lytic C2-C4 lesion focused at the C3 level vertebral body (i.e. destructive lytic lesion of anterior/posterior C3, the C2 spinous process, and anterior C4 vertebral body) [Figure 1]. MRI showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the neck along with lytic lesions involving C3 (i.e. both anterior and posterior elements). Furthermore, an epidural soft-tissue mass causing spinal cord compression was seen posteriorly at the C3-4 level. Although predominantly dorsal, the lesion wrapped circumferentially around the spinal cord bilaterally. The lesion was isointense to hypointense as compared with the spinal cord on T2 weighted images and hyperintense to cord on the T2-weighted image [Figure 2] The PET CT confirmed increase uptake at C3 alone [Figure 3]. The predominant differential diagnoses included lymphoma or metastatic tumors or infection.
In view of a Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score of 14, the evidence of spinal cord compression and likely instability, the patient underwent a C3-4/laminectomy with C2-4/5 posterior fusion. At surgery, the posterior cervical paraspinal musculature infiltrated by tumor and had to be removed. A novel ""three rod construct"" fusion was performed that included C2 pedicle screws, laminar screws, a C4 left pedicle screw with lateral mass fixation of C4 and C5 [Figure 4]. The frozen section diagnosis was lymphoma. Postoperatively, the patient had complete neurological recovery except for bladder dysfunction.
Histopathology was consistent with a lymphoproliferative disorder (i.e. with follicles of different size with abnormal germinal structures at their centres with hyaline-vascular or ""burnt-out"" appearances) [Figure 5]. The Mantle zone was expanded with concentric layering and an ""onion skin"" appearance. Immunohistochemical stains revealed a normal distribution of B and T cells and intact germinal centres with a normal distribution of dendritic reticulum cells.","1. Lymphoma 2. Metastatic tumor 3.

"A woman in her 60s had discomfort in her back. She had been pointed out to have a cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas by a medical examination from three years prior to this presentation. It was diagnosed to be an IPMN of the side branch which measured about 30 mm in diameter. On our examination by abdominal US the lesion had increased to a diameter of 35 mm. Her medical history included appendectomy at 15 years of age. Laboratory data showed the serum CA19-9 level to be slightly elevated at 52.9 U/mL. Abdominal US showed the multilocular cystic lesion to measure 35 mm in size and be located within the pancreatic tail. The borders were clearly demarcated and the lesion showed internal heterogeneity. Contrast enhanced abdominal CT revealed a multilocular cystic lesion, measuring 35 mm in size, within the pancreatic tail. The solid component in the dorsal portion was revealed and showed enhancement similar to the spleen (artery phase) (Fig. 4A), (portal phase) (Fig. 4B). An abdominal MRI showed a multilocular cystic lesion having a low T1 signal and a high T2 signal. EUS showed a 35 mm multilocular cystic lesion within the pancreatic tail with an internal nodule (Fig. 5). ERCP views showed no papillary orifice dilatation or mucus. The cystic lesion was not in continuity between the pancreatic duct and the cyst. A cytologic examination of pancreatic juice showed no malignant cells. Given that cystic neoplasms including IPMN were included in the differential diagnosis, we proceeded with resection by a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. The gross appearance showed a multi cystic lesion measuring 35 mm in size with a hyalinized fibrous capsule. The serosity was accumulated in the lumen (Fig. 6A). The histopathological views were similar to case 1 (Fig. 6B and C) and","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. IPMN of Pancreas 2. Mucinous Cystic Neoplasm 3.

"A 16-year-old male presented for evaluation of an indentation of his right parietal skull. The patient had first noted the indentation 2 weeks prior with no recent change in size. He had been involved in a 4-wheeler accident 2 years before and was evaluated for a possible concussion during a football game about one and a half years prior to presentation. The patient described having occasional headaches, but had no local tenderness or other neurological symptoms.
On examination, the patient was noted to have a palpable defect and indentation of the right parietal bone. The overlying scalp was unremarkable and he was neurologically intact.
The patient's previous imaging was reviewed. The first study, from 2 years prior, showed a skull defect in the right parietal bone [Figure 1a]. The second and third computed tomography (CT) scans showed progressive erosion of the skull [Figure 1b and c]. The defect did not appear to involve the dura or scalp. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained and confirmed the localization of the lesion to the skull [Figure 1e-f].
Excision of the skull defect and right parietal cranioplasty with titanium plate was performed. The overlying tissue was grossly abnormal, measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter, and was removed en bloc. The underlying bone was thin and eggshell like with a trabeculated pattern, especially in the center. Peripherally, the bone was thickened with a sponge-like appearance. The abnormal tissue portion could be seen replacing the diploic space while leaving the inner and outer table intact at the periphery. The dura was not involved and was stripped from the bone and left intact. The abnormal bone was then removed and a mesh titanium plate was used to replace the cranial defect [Figures 1d and 3].
The patient tolerated the operation well and had no immediate operative or perioperative complications. The right parietal indentation was corrected and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 2.
On gross examination, the soft tissue lesion appeared rubbery, yellow, and avascular. The tissue consisted predominantly of dense fibrous tissue with a few foci of woven bone at the periphery adjacent to the eroded bone. Angulated spicules of bone were rare, some of which lacked osteoblastic rimming while others were rimmed. There was minimal inflammation.","1. Fibrous dysplasia 2. Osteoma cutis 3.

"A 42-year-old woman presented to our department with slight visual deterioration [Figure 1a]. Intracranial computed tomography (CT) showed a high-attenuated mass, including granular-like dots in the sellar and suprasellar regions, accompanied by an expansion of the sella turcica [Figure 1b and c]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed well-circumscribed, globular masses. The solid part was isointense, but the inside part of the mass was low intensity on T1-weighted imaging (WI) and T2-WI, and homogeneously enhanced to a moderate degree with gadolinium (Gd). The tumor extended into the suprasellar region, compressing the optic chiasm. The Gd-enhanced anterior pituitary gland was displaced supra-anteriorly, and high intensity on T1-WI suggested that the posterior pituitary appeared [Figure 2a-c]. Measurements of levels of hormones related to the anterior pituitary showed mild hyperprolactinemia (prolactin: 34.6 ng/ml; normal, <32.7 ng/ml). In terms of posterior pituitary function, there was not recognized diabetes insipidus. Preoperative differential diagnoses included pituitary adenoma, germ-cell tumor, sellar meningioma, pituicytoma, and glioma arising from the posterior pituitary. To confirm the histological diagnosis, ETSS was performed. Intraoperative findings demonstrated that this tumor was solid and extremely firm, including myriad yellowish granules without bleeding [Figure 3a and b]. The tumor originated from the posterior pituitary gland and had a clear margin between it and the anterior pituitary gland [Figure 3c]. Subtotal resection was achieved to reduce compression of the optic nerve [Figure 3d]. Pathological examination with hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrated round or polygonal cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. Most nuclei were round to oval, with no evidence of cellular atypia or mitotic figures. In addition, perivascular lymphocytic aggregates were recognized [Figure 4a and b]. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of cytoplasmic granules was resistant to diastase digestion [Figure 4c and d]. Immunohistochemical studies were performed with antibodies for S-100, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Ki-67, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). Tumor cells were immunoreactive for S-100 protein, but negative for GFAP [Figure 5a and b]. The Ki-67 (MIB-1) proliferation-related labeling index was low, at 2.0% [Figure 5c]. In addition, almost all tumor cells appeared strongly positive for TTF-1 [Figure 5d]. Taking all these results into account,","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Pituitary Adenoma 2.

"A 2-year-old girl was brought to the Kintampo Municipal (District) Hospital in rural Ghana because the child's mother noticed a mass in the abdomen. The mother related that she had noticed it for some time, but wasn't sure for how long. She stated that the child had no changes in her eating or defecation pattern, no bleeding or bruising, fever, night sweats, behavioral changes or any other pertinent medical history.
On physical exam, the 10 Kg child had a normal physical exam other than a 10 x 5 cm mass overlying the right colon (Figure 1). It appeared to be mobile and non-tender. There was no evidence of an underlying infectious process, bowel obstruction, organomegaly, mechanical difficulties with breathing, lymphadenopathy, or compromised venous return from the mass. The mass caused no venous return or intestinal motility. The liver could be felt as a discrete organ.
Her urinalysis was normal and a complete blood count demonstrated a Hgb 10.1 g/dL, WBC 7.2 x 109/L, and a normal differential. An ultrasound demonstrated a non-specific, probably cystic mass in the abdomen without any other identifiable pathology. An upright radiograph showed displaced bowel. No other laboratory tests or imaging modalities were available at this hospital.
Clinicians suggested that the child be taken to another facility, but the mother's finances, family situation, and reluctance to go elsewhere precluded that option. When it became clear that the mother would not take the child to the closest hospital with better diagnostic and treatment facilities, the decision was made to operate. The general physician, who also does surgery, performed the procedure.
Given the prevalence of parasitosis in the population and the child's rather benign presentation, the preoperative diagnosis was a probable parasitic cyst. The child was brought to the theater where, under general anesthesia, a midline laparotomy was performed. A large, smooth, glistening mass was immediately apparent occupying the right side and around 1/3 of the total abdomen. It was isolated from the iliac mesentery and removed intact (Figure 2). It weighed 1Kg. The child had an uneventful recovery. The specimen was sent to a pathologist at another hospital.
The pathology report showed a ""huge cystic mass measuring about 10 cm in diameter and roughly spherical in shape containing serous fluid. Cut section reveals copious serous fluid.""","1. Ovarian Cyst 2. Mesenteric Cyst 3. Choledochal Cyst 4. Enteric Duplication Cyst 5. Hydatid Cyst"
"A 68-year-old woman presented with symptoms of appetite loss, weight loss, and abdominal pain that had persisted for 4 months. During a general health examination at a local clinic, para-aortic LAP was detected by abdominal tomography. Tru-Cut biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma with probable primary ovarian or other serosal origin. She was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and management. There was no significant physical findings. Except for anemia (level of hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dl), hematological and biochemical parameters were normal. The level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in her serum was elevated to 50 ng/mL (normal: 0-32 ng/mL), whereas levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (normal: 0-3 ng/mL), and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) (normal: 0-10 mlU/ml) in the serum were within the normal limits. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed gastric wall thickness at the lesser curvature of the mid body in addition to para-aortic lymph node enlargement. Upper digestive tract endoscopy showed a 5-6 cm-ulcerofungating mass in the lesser curvature of the gastric body. Histopathologic findings following gastroduodenoscopy revealed an invasive poorly differantiated adenocarcinoma. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and esophagojejunostomy were performed. Precise histopathological examination of resected specimens revealed the presence of a moderate-to-poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma, with features of YST. An elevated tumor, 6x5x3 cm in size, with surface ulceration and hemorrhage was located in the antral minor curvature of the stomach. The tumor was primarily located in the mucosa and submucosa.","1.

"A 50-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma (MM) in complete remission after high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue was admitted with swelling and overtearing of the left eye. With the prediagnosis of NLD obstruction, dacryoscintigraphy was planned. In two weeks, erythema and swelling around the left eye and nose became evident. Antimicrobial therapy for one week was given with suspicion of dacryocystitis. Yet, the symptoms progressed with additional symptoms of diplopia and bloody discharge from left nose (fig. 1). MRI of the orbit and paranasal sinuses revealed a 3 x 5 x 7.5 cm mass in the left sinonasal area infiltrating the left anterior, medial, posterior ethmoidal sinuses, left nasal cavity, left maxillary sinus, left orbit, left soft and hard palates and displacing the left globe laterally. The mass also extended to the NLD, the left pterygomaxillary fossa, infratemporal fossa and middle cranial fossa (fig. 2). Excisional biopsy of the paranasal sinus revealed diffuse CD38-positive plasma cell infiltration with kappa light chain restriction (fig. 3). On serum protein electrophoresis, a monoclonal protein of 0.01 g/dl was present and immunofixation electrophoresis in serum and urine showed the same amount of paraproteinemia as at the time of initial diagnosis as MM. Serum kappa light chain levels were increased (882 mg/l). Serum albumin and beta 2-microglobulin levels were normal; serum LDH level was slightly increased.","1.

"An 11-year-old boy presented with a history of a sudden loss of consciousness followed by vomiting, the day before. His past medical history revealed right-sided hemiplegia and UMN facial palsy one year earlier. On examination, the patient was conscious, oriented to time, place and person. He had hemiplegic gait, increased muscle tone and decreased power on the right side.
During last hospitalization, an MRI study was performed to define the extent of his neurological lesions. An acute infarct was noted on T2, FLAIR and DW images in the left gangliocapsular region (Figure 1A, 1B). MR Angiogram showed complete cut-off of segment M1 of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and an aneurysm in the intradural segment of the right vertebral artery (Figure 2). After one month, follow-up MRI with MRA showed gliotic area in the left gangliocapsular region and a partially recanalized, tortuous, narrowed left MCA (Figure 3A, 3B).
On digital subtraction angiography (DSA), left MCA appeared irregular, narrowed, and tortuous, and multiple aneurysms were seen in distal branches of bilateral MCA (right>left) (Figures 4, 5) and in the intradural segment of the right vertebral artery (Figure 6A, 6B). The lesions had focal fusiform morphology suggestive of myxomatous aneurysms. Further on the patient was sent for 2-D echocardiogram. Doppler echocardiography showed a left atrial myxoma, 5.2x5.1x2.1 cm in size, which originated from the inferior inter-atrial septum and prolapsed into the left ventricle (Figure 7A).

"A 70-year-old male smoker (1 pack a day for 40 years) presented in April 2014 with painless, subacute, bilateral visual decline of 1 month's duration. His past medical history was unremarkable; however, weight loss of 17 kg in recent months as well as myalgia and fatigue were noted.
Examination revealed a bilateral best corrected visual acuity of 20/30. There was no color vision loss. The intraocular pressure values were within the normal range in both eyes. While the anterior chamber was quiet, mild to moderate vitritis was observed in both eyes. Despite the mildly hazy view, indirect ophthalmoscopy yielded no change in the posterior segments (Fig. 1 a-h). A fluorescein angiogram revealed no abnormality (Fig. 1 e, f).
Optical coherence tomography images displayed normal foveal architecture with a few hyper-reflective dots in the posterior vitreous of both eyes corresponding to the vitreous cells (Fig. 1 g, h). The initial diagnosis was bilateral intermediate uveitis.
A full systemic and laboratory work-up was performed in collaboration with a rheumatologist and pulmonologist. Lab investigations included a complete blood count; analysis of serum liver enzymes, renal function, electrolytes, inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein), angiotensin-converting enzyme, and rheumatological markers (antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and rheumatoid factor); infection screening (syphilis and tuberculosis); brain magnetic resonance imaging; and chest radiography. Treatment with 40 mg oral prednisolone was initiated once an infectious etiology was excluded. Finally, positron emission tomography (PET-CT) scanning was used to explore the possibility of sarcoidosis or malignancy.
The PET-CT images revealed an increased uptake of 2-(fluorine-18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose in area of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes (Fig. 2). To determine the nature of the primary tumor, a biopsy was performed during a bronchoscopy. SCLC (T2N3M0) was established the histopathological examination. The patient was then referred to an oncologist for additional treatment.
After 2 weeks of oral steroid therapy, a subsequent examination yielded a visual acuity of 20/20 and very little lingering bilateral haze (Fig. 3). The patient began a course of chemotherapy, and oral steroid treatment was tapered and terminated.","1. Sarcoidosis 2. Small Cell Lung Cancer 3. Lymphoma 4. Tuberculosis 5. Syphilis"
"A 61-year-old Japanese male was seen at an outside hospital with abdominal pain and distention. An intraabdominal mass was found on abdominal computed tomography (CT), and he was referred for further evaluation. Both parents had died of hepatic cirrhosis. On physical examination, he was afebrile, with mild tenderness in the upper abdomen and with massive distention. Routine blood tests showed: WBC 24,300/mul, Hb 7.3 g/dl, FDP 123.7 mug/ml, D-dimer 111.2 ng/ml, T-Bili 1.24 mg/dl, AST 35 mU/ml, LDH 810 mU/ml, ALP 392 mU/ml, ChE 99 mU/ml, CRP 18.28 mg/dl, HBs antigen negative, HCV antibody positive, CEA 1.2 ng/ml, and CA19-9 5 U/ml. Repeat CT showed a large solitary heterogeneous mass, 25 cm in diameter, in the left upper quadrant with evidence of intratumoral bleeding and irregular enhancement peripherally (arrowhead, fig. 1). There was no clear distinction between the mass and the left lateral segment of the liver. The anterior wall of the stomach was diffusely adherent to the posterior side of the mass. The left side of the diaphragm was also invaded (arrowhead, fig. 2). The tumor seemed to originate from the gastric wall and was suspected to be a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Needle biopsy revealed only a few spindle-shaped atypical cells.
Surgery was performed due to persistent anemia and exacerbation of abdominal pain. Intraoperative findings revealed that the tumor was densely adherent to the lateral segment of the liver, gallbladder, anterior wall of the stomach, left side of the diaphragm and parietal peritoneum. Lateral segmentectomy, total gastrectomy, cholecystectomy and partial resection of the diaphragm and parietal peritoneum were performed, with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The tumor measured 20x15x8 cm. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of histologic sections of the resected specimen showed a malignant neoplasm with undifferentiated spindle cells. Malignant cells with glandular formations similar to intrahepatic bile ducts showed a transition from a differentiated component to an undifferentiated one between the tumor and the liver. Tumor cells invaded the intrahepatic bile duct and replaced normal bile duct epithelium. The carcinomatous component (<10% of the cells) stained positive for cytokeratin-7 and cytokeratin-19, but negative for hepatocytes. The sarcomatous component (~90% of the cells) stained positive for vimentin and keratin-1, but negative for cytokeratin-7, cytokeratin-19 and hepatocytes. The adenocarcinoma appeared to be derived from the intrahepatic bile duct with transformation to sarcomatous cells.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1.

"A male newborn, born at a gestational age of 39 weeks and four days, was found to have swelling in the left thigh, with limited mobility at birth, and was admitted to Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. Physical examination revealed swelling in the left lower extremity, with a circumference of 29 cm ( Figure 1A ), local skin temperature, and limited mobility, while the right lower extremity had a circumference of 20 cm with normal mobility. After admission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and enhanced CT scans of the lower limb were complete, and the results revealed a soft tissue mass in the thigh, measuring approximately 8.25 cm x 8.72 cm x 7.86 cm, with possible hemorrhage ( Figures 2A, B . Subsequently, an ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy of the left thigh mass was performed under general anesthesia, and the histopathological results ( Figure 3 ) suggested a soft tissue tumor with spindle cells.

"A 56-year-old male was referred to our hospital for surgical resection of a posterior mediastinal tumor in July 2014. A local doctor had originally diagnosed the tumor in 2005, and it had gradually increased in size until March 2014. The patient did not have any health problems or symptoms suggestive of a history of hematologic disorder or chronic anemia. Laboratory tests for tumor detection, including those implementing tumor markers, were within normal limits. A chest roentgenogram and computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor mass shadow in the right lower posterior mediastinum. The tumor was 4.3 cm in diameter and was evident on the side of the T9 thoracic vertebrae (Fig. 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the signal intensity of the tumor was low in the T1 weighted image and disproportionately high in the T2 weighted image (Fig. 2).
Differential diagnoses included neurogenic tumor, malignant lymphoma, pleural mesothelioma, lipoma, liposarcoma, or an extra-adrenal myelolipoma. We performed tumor resection by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Surgery revealed that the tumor in the posterior mediastinum was a well-encapsulated, elastic, soft, and dark red mass (Fig. 3).
Histopathological findings of the resected specimens revealed a predominantly mature adipose tissue with hematopoietic tissue comprised of erythroblasts, megakaryocytes, and granulocytes (Fig. 4).

"A 32-year-old female patient reported with a chief complaint of a large swelling in her right back teeth region since several months. Clinical examination revealed a 2 x 1.5 cm2 in dimensions, well-circumscribed, lobulated and pinkish mass on the right retromolar area [Figure 1]. The swelling was soft in consistency and nontender on palpation. There was no paresthesia, facial asymmetry or regional lymphadenopathy noted. Normal complement of dentition was seen. Provisional diagnosis of irritational fibroma was made. Differential diagnosis included peripheral ossifying fibroma, peripheral giant cell granuloma, pyogenic granuloma, mucocele, lipoma, other benign mesenchymal tumors and benign salivary gland neoplasms. Following written consent from the patient, the growth including the normal surrounding tissue was excised under local anesthesia. Postoperative period was uneventful.
Excisional biopsy specimen was fixed in 10% formalin and sent to the Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology for histopathological examination. Histopathologically, hematoxylin and eosin stained sections revealed a well-circumscribed tumor composed of granular cells that were arranged in solid sheets, alveoli, nests, columns or cords with scattered focal clear cells throughout the tumor tissue, separated by a delicate fibrovascular network [Figure 2]. On higher magnification, the tumor cells were polyhedral to round with distinct cell borders. Abundant cytoplasm, with centrally located nucleus and little mitotic activity were seen [Figure 3]. Features were in favor of oncocytoma rather than fibroma. To confirm the diagnosis, phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin (PTAH) staining was carried out, which revealed abundant coarse cytoplasmic granules that correspond to abundance of mitochondria [Figure 4].","1.

"A 72-year-old Caucasian man came to our attention after the appearance of an ulcerative lesion on the left nipple associated with an increased volume of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes. The patient underwent ultrasound examination, which showed a retroareolar lesion with irregular contours, a predominantly hypoechoic component, a maximum diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of 10 mm, and powerful Doppler vascular signals. A needle biopsy of the lesion was performed. The pathologist diagnosed a carcinoma with syringoid features. The patient underwent a radical mastectomy and ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection.
Histopathological examination showed the presence of a differentiated cutaneous adnexal carcinoma, with syringoid and microcystic morphology, ulcerated and infiltrating subcutaneous tissue with perineural invasion, and a desmoplastic stromal reaction (Figures 1-3). Metastases were found in four of the 16 lymph nodes removed. On immunohistochemical staining, the tumor cells expressed carcinoembryonic antigen (Figure 4), cytokeratin (Pan), cytokeratin 7, and p63 protein (Figure 5), and were found to be negative for S100 protein, estrogen, and progesterone receptors.","1.

"A 41-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal finding during an upper gastric endoscopic examination at an outpatient clinic. Her medical history included uterine myoma, duodenal ulcer, and hypothyroidism. Her family history indicated that her mother had thyroid, colorectal, and uterine cancer. The patient was currently undergoing thyroid hormone treatment. Her physical examination results were normal, and the laboratory data were within normal limits (data not shown). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the presence of a SMT with a delle in the greater curvature of the lower body of the stomach (Fig. 1a). On endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), the tumor had a low echo pattern and an irregular shape and was located in the submucosal layer of the stomach (Fig. 1b). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen showed that the gastric tumor was hypervascular in the arterial phase (Fig. 1c) and exhibited continuous enhancement in the post-venous phase (Fig. 1d). The tumor diameter was approximately 1 cm, and no swollen abdominal lymph nodes were observed. The preoperative diagnosis was a gastric SMT with a rich vasculature. However, because the biopsy specimen did not contain any tumor tissue, we were unable to exclude malignant tumors such as gastrointestinal storomal tumors. The patient underwent NEWS (Fig. 2a-d); the operative time was 214 min. No adverse events occurred during or after the operation, and the patient was discharged 6 days after NEWS. Macroscopic examination of the resected tumor showed that the tumor was 9 x 8 mm in size and had well-defined borders. Microscopic examination revealed a proliferation of tumor cells with spindle-shaped nuclei in the submucosa (Fig. 3a, b).
Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the tumor was positive for D2-40 (Fig. 3c) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (Fig. 3d), but negative for c-kit (Fig. 3e), discovered on gastrointestinal storomal tumors (Fig. 3f), desmin (Fig. 3g), S100 (Fig. 3h), Melan-A (Fig. 3i), signal tranducer and transactivator 6 (Fig. 3j), insulinoma-associated protein1 (Fig. 3k), CXCL13 (Fig. 3l), ETS transcription factor (Fig. 3m), follicular dendritic cell (Fig. 3n), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Fig. 3o), human melanoma black, h-caldesmon, and CD1a (Fig. 3p), 10 (Fig. 3q), 21 (Fig. 3r), 23 (Fig. 3s), 31 (Fig. 3t), 34 (Fig. 3u), 68 (Fig. 3v), and 163 (Fig. 3w). Approximately, 1-2% of the tumor cell nuclei expressed the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Fig. 3x). There was some nuclear differentiation, but no necrosis.","Gastrointestinal stromal tumor  Gastric schwannoma   Glomus tumor  Leiomyoma   Angiomyolipoma"
"A 47-year-old woman with a tumor in her right breast was referred to our hospital. Both her mother and older sister had been diagnosed previously with breast cancer. She had undergone surgery twice to treat a benign thyroid tumor. During the physical examination, no mass was palpable in either breast. Ultrasonography revealed an irregular marginated hypoechoic mass measuring 15.1 x 15.0 x 9.4 mm in the 12 o'clock region of the right breast (Fig. 1a) and an irregular marginated hypoechoic mass measuring 24.8 x 21.9 x 10.6 mm in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast (Fig. 1b). Core-needle biopsies were performed at each mass site. Pathological examination of the core-needle biopsies specimen confirmed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the right mammary gland and invasive ductal carcinoma in the left mammary gland. Computed tomography scan did not reveal lymph node metastases or distant metastases (Fig. 2a). Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the primary tumor of the right mammary gland to be a mass 15 mm in size and likely to be DCIS (Fig. 2b). Contrast-enhanced MRI of the left mammary gland exhibited early phase linear enhancement (Fig. 2c). Bone scintigraphy revealed no metastasis to the bone. The preoperative diagnosis was stage 0 (cTisN0M0) right breast cancer and stage IIA (cT2N0M0, estrogen receptor [ER]-negative, progesterone receptor [PgR]-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative, with low Ki67 expression) left breast cancer.

"A 49-year-old female presented with a new-onset generalized seizure and was found to have multiple hyperdense masses with calcifications in the right hemisphere on computed tomography. A brain magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast demonstrated ten distinct dural-based, homogeneously enhancing lesions within the right hemisphere (Figure 1a-c), the largest measuring 5 x 8 cm (arrow, Figure 1c) and effacing the lateral ventricles. On examination, she was neurologically intact. Her medical history was significant for basal cell carcinoma of the face excised four years earlier. Family history was unremarkable.
She was taken to the operating room for resection of the dominant right parafalcine mass (arrow, Figure 1c) and four other (arrow, Figure 1b) lesions that were amenable to the same incision and craniotomy access. Although the tumors all displayed a mildly elevated Ki-67 index of 5-10% on histologic examination, they did not meet criteria for an atypical meningioma diagnosis and thus","Meningiomas  Multiple Meningeal Metastases Primary Brain Tumors Neurocysticercosis  Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation"
"A 40-year-old woman had been diagnosed with ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma thirteen years ago and had undergone hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, lymphadenectomy, and additional chemotherapy for twelve cycles. The patient had no regular reexaminations and found no discomfort after the procedures. Seven years ago, the patient presented with a mass in the left breast that was localized, palpable and painless. The serum cancer antigen 125 level reached 87 U/mL. The patient had no familial history of breast cancer. Ultrasound (US) (4 MHz, Mylab 90, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) findings showed an oval cystic mass measuring 8*6*7 cm3 in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. The mass was anechoic with an uneven wall thickness (Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (3.0 T, Signa HDx, GE, Connecticut, USA) findings showed a lobulated cystic mass measuring 7*6*6 cm3 located in the left breast. The mass showed a slightly high signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) (3.0 T; TR 400 ms, TE 7 ms, flip angle 90 ), slightly high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) (3.0 T; TR 2800 ms, TE 108 ms, flip angle 90 ) and low signal intensity on short time inversion recovery (STIR) imaging (3.0T; TR 7800 ms, TE 52 ms, IT 175 ms, flip angle 90 ). The cystic wall and septum of the mass were unevenly thick and showed slight and localized enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) (3.0T; TR 4 ms, TE 2 ms, flip angle 14 , Gd-DTPA 0.1 mmol/kg) (Figure 1B-E). Unfortunately, the patient had not undergone mammographic (MM) examination. Histological examination after lumpectomy showed an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT-1) and negative for gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15) (Figure 1F-G).","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1.

"A 77-year-old man presented with depressive mood, asthenia, anorexia and weight loss of 20 kg. He also had a 1-month history of an enlarging and non-painful breast lump (Fig. 1). He did not have fever, night sweats, cough or breathlessness. He denied trauma or contact with tuberculosis. Physical examination revealed a firm and elastic mass in the internal quadrants of the left breast with well-defined contours, about 6 cm in diameter. Local temperature was normal and the overlying skin and nipple were intact. There was no evident neck or axillary palpable adenopathy. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count within normal limits, haemoglobin of 12.1 g/dl and C-reactive protein of 5.42 mg/dl; all other blood chemistry results were within normal limits. Radiography showed no obvious lesions (Fig. 2). Mammary ultrasound revealed in the inner quadrants of the left breast a thick-walled cystic formation measuring 69x20 mm, with detritus in the region of greatest slope. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of a white fluid revealed a necrotic background with granulomas without neoplastic cells. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and acid-fast bacilli stain of the aspirate were both positive for tuberculosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed a liquid collection in the left anterior thoracic wall, measuring 31x80 mm, associated with irregularity and discontinuity of the 4th left costal cartilage, with a fistulous tract that crossed the cartilage into a small locus posterior to the left internal mammary artery; in the upper left lobe there was a cavitated nodule measuring 22 mm, compatible with an active tuberculous process (Figs. 3 and 4). Positron emission tomography (PET) showed a possible nodule in the left upper lobe and bilateral mediastinum-hilar adenopathy, with increased uptake of FDG-F18 (Fig. 5).
Peripheral uptake of FDG-F18 was noted as well in a hypodense mass in the left anterior thoracic wall. An interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) was positive and HIV serology was negative. A sputum smear was positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) which was also positive by Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Sputum culture was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex that was sensitive to all tested drugs.","1. Disseminated Tuberculosis 2. Breast Tuberculosis 3. Pulmonary Tuberculosis 4.

"A 44-year old female patient presented with a clinical history of breast cosmetic augmentation surgery by saline-filled silicone implant, about 14 years ago. She had recently experienced pain, tenderness, breast enlargement and discomfort associated with rather firm indurations around the implant of the right breast, radiating into the right arm, for few months. There was history of radiation of pain into the right arm.
The Sonography was non-diagnostic because of the presence of breast implant. On systemic examination, neither lymphadenopathy nor hepatosplenomegaly were detected. There was no evidence of cutaneous involvement. Imaging studies also ruled out the possibility of any systemic disease.
During the operation, large amounts of unusual fibrinous material were found around the saline-filled breast implant, mainly located in the lower inner quadrant LIQ. Then the suspicious tissues were biopsied and submitted for histological examination. The necrotic debris and surrounding tissue were fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Representative sections of the whole specimen were embedded in paraffin blocks, processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for routine histological examination; also serial sections for immunohistochemical studies were prepared. Immunohistochemical staining was as performed by using antibodies, summarized in Table 1.
Under light microscopy, sections revealed predominance of necrosis intermingled with particles of neoplastic tissue of lymphoid origin, composed of many large anaplastic lymphoid cells with large lobulated nuclei, showing rather irregular nuclear membrane and one or more prominent basophilic nucleoli. The cytoplasm was slightly basophilic with prominent Golgi region. Mitotic figures were frequent. There were also many histiocytes, containing abundant pale cytoplasms. Some sections included portions of a dense fibrous capsule, associated with diffuse marked infiltration of eosinophils.
The anaplastic cells exhibited positive immunoreactions for leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CD3, CD30 (Figure 1A) and granzyme B (Figure 1B). However, they were negative for AlK (Figure 1C), epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, CD 5, CD 7 and CD20.","1. Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma 2. Breast Implant-Associated ALCL 3.

"A 62-year-old female underwent right partial nephrectomy 2 years earlier. Postoperative pathological diagnosis revealed stage I RCC, clear cell type. Also, she underwent endoscopic submucosal resection due to early gastric cancer 7 years ago. Preoperative Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan using a single portal venous phase was obtained in the initial assessment of RCC 2 years ago. It revealed a well-defined, slightly high density mass, about 70 Hounsfield unit (HU), size 1.7 cm x 1.4 cm, in the lower pole of kidney. The radiological findings diagnosed the lesion as benign such as hemorrhagic renal cyst. During routine follow-up assessment, an enhanced CT scan showed a slightly increase in the size of the slightly high attenuating mass, 60 HU, approximate measuring 2.1 cm x 1.7 cm. The mass demonstrated partly exophytic growth and equivocal peripheral enhancing septa (Fig. 1A). Moreover, there was no fat-density lesion or enhancing solid component in the mass. On MRI, the lesion correlating with CT image appeared as a well-defined tumor with dependent hemorrhagic component. Relative to the normal renal cortex, the nondependent portion showed intermediate signal intensity on axial T2-weighted image and T1-weighted image (Fig. 1B, C). On dynamic contrast-enhanced scan, the mass showed a few minimally thickened enhancing septa, about 3 mm in thickness in the peripheral portion (Fig. 1D, E). There was no metastasis or lymph node enlargement. Our initial differential diagnosis included renal tumor with hemorrhage such as RCC, complicated renal cyst with hemorrhage. The patient underwent partial nephrectomy due to history of RCC in contralateral kidney. Invasion of the surrounding tissue was not observed. Grossly, the mass was a 2.3 cm sized, well-demarcated multilocular cystic mass filled with serous and hemorrhagic fluid. Microscopic examination revealed that the mass was composed by variable sized cysts without expansile growth. The cysts were lined by single layer of tumor cells with abundant clear or granular cytoplasm with low grade nuclei (WHO/ISUP grade 2).","1. Clear Cell RCC 2. Complicated Renal Cyst 3.

"A 20-year-old female from Ethiopia presented with a giant skull-based tumor with a massive orbitocranial deformity distorting her facial anatomy and right eye.
Diagnostic angiography, CT, and MRI revealed a giant, moderately hypervascular, multilobulated, and peripherally calcified expansile mass lesion which appeared to arise from the skull base and occupy the entire nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, and ethmoid sinus regions [Figure 3]. The intracranial extension of the tumor obliterated the sella turcica, bilaterally invaded the cavernous sinuses, and caused extensive elevation and splaying of the internal carotid arteries, anterior cerebral arteries, optic chiasm, and intracranial optic nerves. The mass measured approximately 10 cm x 8 cm x 11 cm. There was no evidence of edema or gliotic reaction in the adjacent brain parenchyma.
The patient underwent resection of the tumor through a subcranial transfacial approach. A bicoronal incision was carried down, preserving the galeal layer for possible use as a graft later. An incision was made over the face and nose to expose the front of the tumor. We broke through the thin bony shell and entered the multiloculated cystic tumor cavity. Fluid was drained and the operating microscope was brought into the field. This allowed us to work circumferentially to remove the entire solid tumor components all the way back to the circumferential bony shell. This left a massive cavity measuring over 15 cm in diameter. All soft tissues were removed and bone was drilled down. The lateral wall of the tumor was drilled, allowing for replacement of the globe to a more natural position. Bone was also drilled off the medial wall to decompress the lesion. The dura was never entered. Calvarial bone grafts were harvested by taking a large frontal parasagittal craniotomy.
A craniofacial reconstructive surgeon with the help of an oculoplastic specialist completed a complex reconstruction. We used the bone grafts to reconstruct a new orbit and mid-face. Repair of the skull bone and scalp was undertaken in a second surgery by our craniofacial/plastic surgeon.
Histopathological examination demonstrated an ossifying fibroma with a proliferation of plump spindle cells, mostly hypocellular, with focal hypercellular areas. Production of woven bone was seen intermittently with the spindle cells. The spindle cells showed focal areas of storiform arrangement with focal osteoblastic rimming.","1. Ossifying Fibroma 2.

"A 37-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of exertional dyspnea, cough and one recent episode of hemoptysis. At the time of admission, she showed no hypertension or systemic symptoms. A chest radiograph showed a left hilar mass with a lobulated margin (Fig. 1A). The axial and coronal CT scans were obtained with using 16-channel multidetector CT after IV administration of contrast media. A mildly enhancing left hilar mass with an endobronchial protrusion and an extension along the left lingular segmental bronchus was noted (Figs. 1B, C). The lung setting image showed localized emphysema distal to the endobronchial lesion (Fig. 1D).
Bronchoscopy revealed a mutilobular, hypervasacular mass obstructing the lumen of the left lingular segmental bronchus (Fig. 1E). A careful biopsy was taken from the peripheral portion because the tumor tended to bleed. This tumor was believed to be either an endobronchial bronchogenic carcinoma or another type of hypervascular tumor. The pathologic diagnosis was chronic inflammation with granulation tissue, which was not in accordance with the radiologic findings.
We subsequently performed a left upper sleeve lobectomy with dissection of the mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient suffered no hypertensive crisis during or after surgery. The gross examination showed an endobronchially growing solid mass along the bronchial lumen, the so-called toothpaste figure, and this mass measured 7x3 cm in dimension. The remaining lung parenchyma showed no remarkable change (Fig. 1F). The mass showed a yellowish brown granular appearance with infiltration into the bronchial wall. The microscopic examination revealed that the tumor consisted of nests of epitheloid cells in an organoid or alveolar pattern, and this was surrounded by a delicate, richly vascular reticulin network, producing the classic 'zellballen' or basket pattern (Fig. 1G). The tumor cells showed marked nuclear pleomorphism and up to one or two mitotic figures/10 high power fields. There were associated microscopic necrotic foci. Immunohistochemical staining for chromogranin, which is a marker for neuroendocrine tumors, was strongly positive. There was no metastasis observed in the dissected lymph nodes.
After surgery, a CT evaluation of the neck and abdomen demonstrated no abnormal findings. The biochemical study revealed the following: the urine epinephrine level was 2.3 microg/day (0-20 for the normal range), and the norepinephrine level was 37.3 microg/day (15-80 for the normal range).","1.

"Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report. She is a 70-year-old woman who worked as a childcare worker and is now retired. She used to drink 30 g alcohol/day until 10 years ago and she still smokes 5 cigarettes/day. She was diagnosed with depressive syndrome 10 years ago. Currently, she is on Trazodone 100 mg/day and Clonazepam 0.5 mg/day. There are cases of PD (brothers) and depression (mother and maternal grandmother) among her family records.
She first visited neurology clinics 10 years ago with memory loss complaints. On that occasion, cognitive screening tests, blood tests, and CT scan were normal. Complaints were supposed to be in relation with a mood disorder, and no treatment was prescribed. She came again 5 years ago due to impairment of memory. She also complained about unbalanced gait, intentional tremor, and difficulty doing fine tasks. Caregivers referred social, behavioral changes, and personal care difficulties, even when she was still living on her own at that time.
Neurological examination showed hypomimia, mild rigidity in the four limbs, global bradykinesia, and unbalanced gait. There was a mild and mixed (rest and action) tremor affecting the four limbs. Her Mini-Mental Status Examination reflected deficits in memory, while her performance on the Frontal Assessment Battery was notable for impairment in inhibiting automatic responses, verbal fluency, and Trail making tests A & B. She also demonstrated deficits in the memory and verbal fluency sections of the Seven Minute Screen.
Laboratory tests were all normal. Baseline MRI showed mild diffuse atrophy of the cerebrum together with some small vessel lesions affecting periventricular and semioval white matter. Follow-up MRI (5 years later) showed more intense atrophy in the left frontal and temporal lobes (Figure 1A). Tc-99m-HMPAO SPECT showed bilateral but asymmetric hypoperfusion (more on the left side) on frontotemporal lobes (Figure 1B). 18F-FDG-PET showed mild to severe hypometabolism on the left frontotemporal lobe junction, and mild hypometabolism on the left fronto-basal left anterior cingulum regions (Figure 1C). DaTSPECT was informed as for the normal density of presynaptic dopaminergic uptakers (Figure 1D).

"We report the case of a 27-year-old female, with no history of previous breast surgery or irradiation. She reported after four months of breastfeeding a history of painless progressive lump in her left breast.
On examination the patient was in good condition. The right breast was slightly increased in volume. We found a 5 cm lump involving all quadrants of the breast with no cutaneous involvement. Ganglionic area and axilla were free. The sonography showed a hypo echoic (Doppler vascularized) nodular formation with fuzzy limits. The mammography revealed a homogeneous opacity, dense, with poorly defined contours, on the two internal quadrants with a retromammelonal contingent (labelled ACR-3). The trucut biopsy was in favour of a lactating tubular adenoma. The radioclinic discordance, the morphological aspect and the exiguous nature of the material, an immunohistochemical complement was requested. An absence of pancytokeratin labelling contrasted with strong expression of CD31, CD34 (endothelial markers) is described. The proliferation index (Ki67) was estimated at 30%. This led to the conclusion that the phenotypic aspect is related to a vascular proliferation that evokes an angiosarcoma. After a multidisciplinary reassessment, the patient benefited from a conservative treatment by an enlarged excision of the tumour (Fig. 1). The histopathological examination of the surgical specimen found an infiltrating mesenchymal proliferation made of vessels of variable sizes anastomosed to vascular slits with lesional limits (Fig. 2). The endothelial cells were often spindle shaped, with anisocaryotic nuclei and numerous mitoses and reduced cytoplasm (Fig. 3). The immunohistochemical examination on the surgical specimen showed to the same phenotypic profile on biopsy (Fig. 4).","1. Angiosarcoma 2. Lactating tubular adenoma 3. Breast carcinoma 4.

"A 61-year-old woman patient was admitted to the outpatient clinic because of a 31-mm mass in the right adrenal gland after undergoing a computed tomography (CT) scan for COVID-19. The patient has no medical history other than COVID-19. The CT scan showed a cystic necrotic component that caused suspicion of adrenocortical carcinoma or pheochromocytoma. The patient was evaluated for excess hormone production with the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test, serum and urine metanephrines, plasma renin activity, and serum aldosterone. There was no excess hormone production by the adrenal mass. Several imaging studies, in addition to computed tomography scans, were performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a semisolid mass with cystic and necrotic components and peripheral diffusion restriction, which increased suspicion of adrenocortical carcinoma (Figures 1A,B). Therefore, the patient underwent 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). In this imaging study, an enhancement of FDG at the level of malignancy was seen, and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was 9.94 (Figure 2). Due to heterogeneous imaging findings, to exclude silent pheochromocytoma or any metastasis of pheochromocytoma, the patient also underwent metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy; however, there was no enhancement throughout body.
Owing to the suspicious findings in the imaging studies, surgical excision was planned. Because of the small mass size, laparoscopic transabdominal adrenalectomy was applied. During gross examination of the excised material, two components were easily seen (Figure 3). One cystic component with suspected mass and unaffected adrenal gland. After the operation, the patient had nothing remarkable and was discharged postoperative on the third day. Postoperative follow-up was continued until 8 months, and there was no recurrence or any complaints after surgery.

"A 61-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with chief complaints of fever with rash all over the body and loss of appetite (for 1 week), dark-colored stools, and urine (for 3 days) and shortness of breath. The patient had anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Peripheral smear showed signs of hemolytic anemia (anisopoikilocytosis, spherocytes, and polychromasia), and lactate dehydrogenase was raised. Urine findings showed the presence of hemoglobin and bilirubin. Treating physician advised high-resolution computed tomography chest that revealed multiple lymphadenopathy with mild bilateral pleural effusion.
Initial differential diagnosis included lymphoma and infectious mononucleosis (IM) with AIHA. Lymphoma was ruled out on excision biopsy of cervical lymph node. Meanwhile, the patient hemoglobin dropped further and bone marrow biopsy revealed lymphocytosis, and tests for anti- Epstein-Barr virus antibodies were positive. Physician suspected PCH and, therefore, patients' samples were sent to laboratory for direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and indirect antiglobulin test (IAT). While IAT was negative, DAT was positive. Additional test with monospecific antiglobulin reagent exhibited anti-C3d antibody. The thermal amplitude of autoantibodies ranged from 4 C to 22 C. Negative CD55 and CD59 markers ruled out paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
In view of clinical history and positive DAT with C3d specificity, treating physician and laboratory physician discussed and decided to perform DL test.

"A 33-year-old female sought evaluation in our Department of General Surgery with a 2-year history of sporadic abdominal pain that had become aggravated during the past week. The character of pain became sharp and frequent. The pain was localized to the left lower abdomen. There was no nausea and vomiting. There was no history of abdominal trauma. The patient had a congenital anomaly of the kidneys and uterus; there was no menstruation. The patient had undergone an appendectomy in the past. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile. The abdominal examination revealed pain and a mass in the left lower quadrant area upon palpation. The mass was approximately 4 x 5 cm in diameters and was not circumscribed. The patient had no rebound tenderness and muscle rigidity. Laboratory testing revealed the following: white blood cell count, 7.13 x 109/L; neutrophilic granulocytes, 76.8%; hemoglobin, 120 g/L; and platelet count, 322 x 109/L. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an intestinal stromal tumor (Figure 1) and pelvic kidneys (Figure 2). Digestive tract radiography showed possible extraintestinal involvement (Figure 3). An intestinal stromal tumor was diagnosed and an abdominal laparotomy was performed; however, the intestinal tract was normal and a mass was noted in the sigmoid flexure. The tumor exhibited exophytic growth without infiltration and was 6.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm in size. The tumor and colon (proximal and distal length, 10 cm; ~25 cm) were excised. A rapid frozen section pathologic examination revealed a solitary fibrous tumor (SFT). A colon anastomosis was performed and the patient had fully recovered 7-days post-operatively.","1.

"A 69-year-old female with history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia complained of intermittent left hip pain for 3 years with constitutional symptoms. She denied any headache, hearing loss, tinnitus, back pain, joint pain or failure symptoms. There was no history of fracture, trauma or heart failure. On examination, she was unable to ambulate due to her left hip pain. There was no bowing of tibia or femur. Apart from her left hip, her musculoskeletal examinations of other joints and neurological examination were unremarkable. Biochemical tests revealed normal serum calcium and phosphorus with markedly raised alkaline phosphatase (Table 1). The initial differential diagnoses were osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, secondary metastasis or metabolic bone diseases. Her Xray of the hip revealed diffuse sclerotic left pelvic bone and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the hip revealed extensive marrow signal abnormalities at the left pelvic bone (Figure1). The radiological images above were reported as primary, metastatic bone disease or other metabolic bone disorders like PDB. As part of workup of bony lesion in adult to rule out possibility of secondary malignancy, contrast enhanced computed tomography of thorax, abdomen and pelvis (CECT-TAP) were performed which revealed a spiculated lung nodule at the left lower lung lobe, suggestive of lung malignancy (Figure 2).
In order to ascertain the lesion being a primary, metastatic bone tumour or PDB, an open biopsy of the left iliac bone was done. The histopathology result of bone biopsy of the left iliac bone was later reported as Paget's disease of the bone (Figure 3). A CT guided biopsy of the lung mass was done later which revealed adenocarcinoma of the lung (Figure 4). She had F-FDG PET-CECT Scan for staging evaluation and showed intense tracer uptake in the left lower lobe of the lung with multiple mediastinal lymph nodes as well as right sacral bone, right ilium and bodies of L3-L5 suggestive of new bony metastases. There was also diffuse sclerosis of the left hemi pelvis (ilium, ischium and pubic bone) with minimal metabolic activity in keeping with PDB (Figure 5A and B).","1. Paget's disease 2.

"A 24-year-old male presented with recurrent abdominal pain that had started to worsen 2 months previously. He had no relevant family or past medical history. On admission, his vital signs were stable. Physical examination revealed slight tenderness in the epigastric area with no sign of peritoneal irritation. Biochemical investigations yielded the following findings: white blood cell count 6,300/mm3, serum glucose 93 mg/dl, total bilirubin 1.1 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 28 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase 13 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase 61 IU/l, gamma-glutamyltransferase 28 IU/l, amylase 115 IU/l, lipase 45 U/l, alpha-fetoprotein 2.07 ng/ml, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 23.68 U/ml, carcinoembryonic antigen 4.05 ng/ml and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 0.3 mg/l.
Abdominal computed tomography showed a large stone in the common bile duct (CBD) with no marked upstream duct dilatation, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) demonstrated the same stone at the same level with compression of the CBD, suggesting Mirizzi's syndrome. The location of the impacted stone was suspected to be the cystic duct rather than the CBD, which could cause compression of the CBD (fig. 1a). Subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed that the large impacted stone was located in the central CBD. Injected contrast filled the dilated upstream cystic duct and CBD at the same time and demonstrated that the large stone was laterally compressing the CBD (fig. 1a). This finding strongly suggested that an impacted stone in the cystic duct of the gallbladder had caused Mirizzi's syndrome. Selective CBD cannulation was difficult due to the narrowing caused by extrinsic compression and variation in the common pathway of the CBD. However, the gallbladder was not distended and laboratory findings revealed no obstructive pattern typically seen in Mirizzi's syndrome. Following the insertion of a 7-Fr plastic stent (Cook Endoscopy, Winston-Salem, N.C., USA) into the CBD, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was planned.
Laparoscopic operative findings showed that the gallbladder was atrophic; thus, the surgeon planned to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy and to remove the impacted stone via CBD exploration. Intraoperatively, the stone in the CBD was considered to be impacted due to the atrophic gallbladder. However, following removal of the gallbladder and the large impacted stone, surgical exploration revealed a bulging cystic lesion and the surgeon could not find the plastic stent inserted previously in the CBD (fig. 2). Thus, the surgery was converted to laparotomy, which revealed that the saccular dilated cystic lesion with a large impacted stone was a diverticular choledochal cyst. The type II choledochal cyst was excised and choledochoduodenostomy was performed.","1. Mirizzi's syndrome 2. Choledocholithiasis 3. Gallstones 4. Type II choledochal cyst 5. Biliary obstruction"
"A fifty-eight-year-old male with a history of hypertension, anxiety, depression, and chronic low back pain presented with a one-year history of a right parietal scalp mass. He believed that the mass first appeared after he bumped his head, but he was not sure. The patient denied any drainage, pain, numbness, tingling, fever, or redness. Medications included acetaminophen, bacitracin, ranitidine, ketotifen fumarate, ammonium lactate, castellani colorless topical paint, urea 20% cream, celecoxib, and cyclobenzaprine. The patient denied any smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Family history was non-contributory, and he had no known drug allergies. On physical exam, he was found to have a mobile and cystic appearing right parietal scalp mass with a punctum. The differential diagnosis included an epidermal inclusion cyst, pilar cyst, or lipoma.
The patient underwent operative excision five days later under monitored anesthesia care. An elliptical incision was made around the lesion, including the punctum. The cyst was circumferentially dissected. It spontaneously ruptured and the specimen was passed off to pathology. The patient returned for a post-operative visit nine days later. He complained of right scalp incisional pain that was slowly improving but did not have any other issues. His staples were removed at that visit. Post-operative photos are displayed in Figures 1, 2. On pathology, the mass was measured to be 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm and described as pink/tan.","Here are the top 5 possible brief diagnoses:  1. Epidermal inclusion cyst 2. Pilar cyst 3. Lipoma 4.

"A 79-year-old Asian (Japanese) patient was referred to our hospital to undergo further examination for a right testicular tumor. The patient had glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, and benign prostate hyperplasia. The only remarkable physical examination finding was a right testicular mass that was elastic and hard, measuring 5 cm in diameter. The laboratory findings, including several tumor markers (HCG, <0.1 mIU/mL; CEA, 3.3 ng/mL; AFP, 3 ng/mL; CA19-9, 11 U/mL; CA125, 17 U/mL; SCC, 0.8 U/mL; NSE, 11.0 U/mL; sIL-2R, 448.4 U/ml), were normal. CT revealed right testicular mass of 5.4 cm in diameter, without invasion or metastasis [Fig. 1] (see Fig. 2).
Right radical orchiectomy was performed based on the clinical diagnosis of testicular cancer. The resected elastic firm specimen was 6.8 x 4.3 x 5.3 cm. The resected specimen showed an enlarged testis occupied by a white solid tumor. No normal testis was observed. Histologically, the tumor obliterated the underlying testicular parenchyma and there was intertubular growth of tumor cells in peripherally. Neoplastic cells showed plasmacytoid appearance of eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with central nucleoli (Fig. 3a). Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for lambda light chain (Fig. 3b) and negative for kappa light chain (Fig. 3c). Amyloid sedimented on vascular walls and basement membrane of testicular tubules. Amyloid deposits were Congo red-positive (Fig. 3d). Based on these findings, monoclonal plasma cells grew in neoplastic and immunoglobulin light chain had deviation. The tumor was therefore diagnosed as testicular plasmacytoma.
Based on the diagnosis of testicular plasmacytoma, blood and urinary protein analyses, PET-CT, and bone marrow aspiration were performed. M protein was not detected and PET-CT revealed no irregular findings. Thus,","1. Testicular Plasmacytoma 2. Multiple Myeloma 3. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma 4. Amyloidosis 5. Testicular Cancer"
"A 48-year-old woman with a long-standing history of intractable migraine headaches was admitted to our institution's specialty headache unit for aggressive management. She had no known history of peripheral vascular or cardiac disease but has been admitted multiple times for treatment of her headaches since her initial diagnosis in 2003. During the course of each of these hospitalizations, she had received one to two courses of dihydroergotamine mesylate (DHE) 45. During this admission she received two courses of DHE 0.5 mg x 1, then 1 mg every 8 h for a total of eight doses, on days 1-3 and the second course of therapy on days 7-9. Several hours after the final dose of her second round she became obtunded, minimally responsive and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/45 mm Hg. On physical examination her abdomen was moderately distended with few bowel sounds. Her lactate acid level was 4.5 mmol/l, white blood cell count was 18.0 (with 17% bands), and stool was Clostridium difficile negative.
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, given intravenous fluid boluses, started on vasopressors, and given broad spectrum antibiotics. She eventually required intubation. Her chest radiograph was unremarkable, and her abdominal x-rays showed only mild prominence of the colon. Over the next several hours she became progressively acidotic with a worsening bandemia. A bedside colonoscopy showed diffuse ischemic colitis with fecal impaction and no pseudomembranes (fig. 1). The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent a laparotomy. Operative findings showed a peritoneal cavity filled with murky, foul-smelling fluid and gangrene of the descending colon was seen with necrosis in the area immediately distal to the splenic flexure to the sigmoid colon. A large amount of impacted stool was present in the left colon. The vasculature of this area of colon was intact with audible Doppler signals. Upon removal of the gangrenous bowel the patient's condition improved promptly.
Final pathology on the surgical specimen showed 86 cm of patchy, dark green/black large bowel, consistent with ischemic necrosis. The bowel wall was intact throughout.","1. Ischemic Colitis 2.

"A 39-year-old woman (gravida-2, para-2) was presented with menorrhagia and anemia. Preoperative diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging was a 5-cm myoma of the uterus and a 4-cm cystadenoma of the right ovary. Intraoperative findings were significant for an 8-cm uterus and a 4-cm cyst of the right ovary, and total laparoscopic hysterectomy and cystectomy of the right ovary were performed. The anterior wall of the uterus was laparoscopically incised with an ultrasonic scalpel (HARMONIC ACE , Ethicon, United States) to be deformed for vaginal removal. The total weight of the uterus was 190 g. Pathological diagnosis was ESS, formerly referred to as low-grade ESS, and serous cystadenoma of the right ovary. Postoperative thoracic computed tomography (CT) revealed no evidence of lung metastasis; thus,","1. Endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) 2. Serous cystadenoma of ovary 3. Uterine myoma 4.
